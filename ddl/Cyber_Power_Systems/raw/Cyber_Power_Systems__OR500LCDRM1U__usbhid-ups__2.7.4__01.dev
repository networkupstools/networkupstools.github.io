# DEVICE:COMMENT:
# CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U - Inexpensive 1U rack mount UPS
#
# * https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/or500lcdrm1u/
#
# This UPS has the same ondelay/offdelay issue that other Cyberpower UPS's
# have, the UPS expects minutes for those values, and rounds down.
# So the default values of 20 and 30 get rounded down so the UPS shuts
# off immediately.
#
# The `ondelay` for this model doesn't work very well.
#
# * If you give it a value of 60 seconds, the UPS will power back
#   on the load after 60 seconds even if the mains power isn't back.
# * An `ondelay=-1` disables the auto start behavior.
# * Setting an `ondelay` value of 0 seems to be the only useful value.
#   With `ondelay=0` the UPS will start back up immediately if the power
#   is restored after the UPS shuts down, and it will restart the load
#   approximately 10 seconds after a shutdown if the power comes back
#   after the shutdown with delay command is sent.
#
# I would suggest that if the default values are changed for cyberpower
# models, that the `ondelay` be set to a default of 0, and the
# `offdelay` be set to 60.
#
# I've successfully tested the shutdown behavior with this UPS with
# a FreeBSD system (pfSense firewall). The `offdelay` must be set greater
# than 60 and the `ondelay` must be set to 0 for correct behavior.
# (FreeBSD doesn't remount into a RO mode during shutdown, so delayed
# shutdown is absolutely needed to prevent disk corruption).
#
# One last note is that this system doesn't seem to have any nonvolatile
# storage, any values set via `upsrw` are lost when the UPS is restarted.
# So if you want to tweak certain settings you will need to have a way
# to reset them any time the UPS resets.
