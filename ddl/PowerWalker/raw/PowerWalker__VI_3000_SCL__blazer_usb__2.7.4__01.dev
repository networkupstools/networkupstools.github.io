# DEVICE:URL:VENDOR: https://powerwalker.com/?page=product&item=10121144&lang=en

# DEVICE:COMMENT:
# * Manufacturer: PowerWalker
# * Model: VI 3000 SCL
#
# UPS sends a low battery signal that makes NUT issue a shutdown.
# battery.charge.low and battery.runtime.low were only set as
# failsafes during testing.
#
# Protocol is mustek. NOTE THAT nutdrv_qx doesnt connect even
# though it also detects it as mustek like blazer_usb, go figure.
#
# UPS load value is always working correctly.
#
# Temperature is only output when UPS is on battery, value seems correct.
#
# Vendor detection has to be disabled! It doesnt give out information
#  (fails) and causes the UPS to not answer all the time!
#
# Runtime and chargetime based on Manufacturer datasheet,
#  Min/Max Voltages measured. (Brand new unit)
#
# UPS commands:
# * beeper.toggle works, also gives out the correct value.
# * load.on works
# * load.off works
# * shutdown.return works
# * shutdown.stayoff doesnt work
# * shutdown.stop works
# * test.battery.start.deep doesnt work, responds with OK, but no action
# * test.battery.start.quick sometimes works, always responds OK, test is sub 5 seconds
# * test.battery.start value doesnt work, responds with OK, but no action
# * test.battery.stop useless, because only the 5 second test works
