# DEVICE:COMMENT:
# As others have noted in PowerWalker-related issues, the Liebert HID subdriver
# seems to be lacking certain features. For instance input/output voltage,
# frequency and configurable options are missing.
#
# The VID `0x06da` PID `0xffff` is also defined in mge-hid subdriver, which seems
# to have more features than the liebert subdriver, however I have had no luck
# with tricking the driver into using it by just changing the config.
#
# Variables and instant commands seem to be not supported:
#
# ----
# pi@raspberrypi:~ $ upsrw ups
# ----
#
# ----
# pi@raspberrypi:~ $ upscmd -l ups
# Instant commands supported on UPS [ups]:
