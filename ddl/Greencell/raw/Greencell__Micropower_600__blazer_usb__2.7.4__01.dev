# DEVICE:URL:REPORT: https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1080

# DEVICE:COMMENT:
# The UPS looks to be using working with the `blazer_usb` driver,
# different status events are properly reported and my connected
# Raspberry Pi shuts down as expected, but the UPS itself does
# not shut down.
#
# Later discussion in the ticket mentioned that `nutdrv_qx` worked
# but did not detail to what extent, except a subsequent comment:
# ----
#   If I would be able to disable the beeper then I would
#   have achieved all my goals: beeper.toggle command works,
#   but the driver settings alarm_control = disabled and
#   battery_alarm = disabled don't do anything..
# ----
#
# The (v2.7.4) `nut-scanner` tool suggested `nutdrv_atcl_usb` driver
# according to vendorid/productid which is used in many unrelated
# devices, that driver did not support the (Qx) protocol here.
