It used the same design as
the pre-release prototype. This made expansion difficult as the binary
structure used for network communications would break any time a new
variable was added. Due to byte-ordering and struct alignment issues,
the code usually couldn’t talk over the network to a system with a
different architecture. It was also hopelessly bound to one type of UPS
hardware.</p><p>Five more releases followed with this design followed. The last was
0.34, released October 27, 1998.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_june_1999_redesigned_rewritten"></a>June 1999: Redesigned, rewritten</h4></div></div></div><p>Following a long period of inactivity and two months of prerelease
testing versions, 0.40.0 was released on June 5, 1999. It featured a
complete redesign and rewrite of all of the code. The layering was now
in three pieces, with the single driver (smartups) separate from the
server (upsd).</p><p>Clients remained separate as before and still used UDP to talk to the
server, but they now used a text-based protocol instead of the brittle
binary structs. A typical request like "REQ UTILITY" would be answered
with "ANS UTILITY 120.0".</p><p>The ups-trust425-625 driver appeared shortly after the release of
0.40.0, marking the first expansion beyond APC hardware.</p><p>Over the months that followed, the backupspro driver would be forked
from the smartups driver to handle the APC Back-UPS Pro line. Then the
backups driver was written to handle the APC Back-UPS contact-closure
models. These drivers would later be renamed and recombined, with
smartups and backupspro becoming apcsmart, and backups became genericups.</p><p>The drivers stored status data in an array. At first, they passed this data to
upsd by saving it to a file. upsd would reread this file every few seconds to
keep a copy for itself. This was later expanded to allow shared memory mode,
where only a stub would remain on the disk. The drivers and server then passed
data through the shared memory space.</p><p>upsd picked up the ability to monitor multiple drivers on the system, and the
"upsname@hostname" scheme was born. Access controls were added, and then the
network code was expanded to allow TCP communications, which at this point were
on port 3305.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
