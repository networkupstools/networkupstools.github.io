NUT documentation recipes were revised, so many of the text source files
  were renamed to <code class="literal">*.adoc</code> pattern. Newly, a <code class="literal">release-notes.pdf</code> and HTML
  equivalents are generated. Packages which deliver documentation may need
  to update the lists of files to ship. [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1953" target="_top">#1953</a>] Developers may be impacted
  by new <code class="literal">configure --enable-spellcheck</code> toggle (should add spelling checks
  to <code class="literal">make check</code> by default, if tools are available) to facilitate quicker
  acceptance of contributions. Packaging systems may now want to explicitly
  disable it, if it blocks package building (pull requests to update the
  <code class="literal">docs/nut.dict</code> are a better and welcome solution). [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2067" target="_top">#2067</a>]

Several improvements regarding simultaneous support of USB devices that
  were previously deemed "identical" and so NUT driver instances did not
  start for all of them:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem">
Some more drivers should now use the common USB device matching logic
    and the 7 <code class="literal">ups.conf</code> options for that [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1763" target="_top">#1763</a>], and man pages were
    updated to reflect that [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1766" target="_top">#1766</a>];
</li><li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">nut-scanner</code> tool should suggest these options in its generated
    device configuration [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1790" target="_top">#1790</a>]: hopefully these would now suffice for
    sufficiently unique combinations;
</li><li class="listitem">
The <code class="literal">nut-scanner</code> tool should also suggest sanity-check violations
    as comments in its generated device configuration [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1810" target="_top">#1810</a>], e.g. bogus
    or duplicate serial number values;
</li><li class="listitem">
The common USB matching logic was updated with an <code class="literal">allow_duplicates</code>
    flag (caveat emptor!) which may help monitor several related no-name
    devices on systems that do not discern "bus" and "device" values
    (although without knowing reliably which one is which… sometimes it
    is better than nothing) [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1756" target="_top">#1756</a>].

Work on NUT for Windows branch led to situation-specific definitions of
  what in POSIX code was all "file descriptors" (an <code class="literal">int</code> type). Now such
  entities are named <code class="literal">TYPE_FD</code>, <code class="literal">TYPE_FD_SER</code> or <code class="literal">TYPE_FD_SOCK</code> with some
  helper macros to name and determine "invalid" values (closed file, etc.)
  Some of these changes happened in NUT header files, and at this time it
  was not investigated whether the set of files delivered for third-party
  code integration (e.g. C/C++ projects binding with <code class="literal">libnutclient</code> or
  `libupsclient) is consistent or requires additional definitions/files.
  If something gets broken by this, it is a bug to address in future [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1556" target="_top">#1556</a>]

Further revision of public headers delivered by NUT was done, particularly
  to address lack of common data types (<code class="literal">size_t</code>, <code class="literal">ssize_t</code>, <code class="literal">uint16_t</code>,
  <code class="literal">time_t</code> etc.) in third-party client code that earlier sufficed to only
  include NUT headers. Sort of regression by NUT 2.8.0 (note those consumers

Added support for <code class="literal">make install</code> of PyNUT module and NUT-Monitor desktop

The <code class="literal">upsd.conf</code> listing of <code class="literal">LISTEN</code> addresses was previously inverted
  (the last listed address was applied first), which was counter-intuitive
  and fixed for this release. If user configurations somehow relied on this
  order (e.g. to prioritize IPv6 vs. IPv4 listeners), configuration changes

The <code class="literal">upsd</code> configured to listen on IPv6 addresses should handle only
  IPv6 (and not IPv4-mappings like it might have done before) to avoid
  surprises and insecurity — if user configurations somehow relied on
  this dual support, configuration changes may be needed to specify both
  desired IP addresses. Note that the daemon logs will now warn if a
  host name resolves to several addresses (and will only listen on the
  first hit, as it did before in such cases). [<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2012" target="_top">#2012</a>]

A definitive behavior for <code class="literal">LISTEN *</code> directives became specified, to try
  handling both IPv4 and IPv6 "any" address (subject to <code class="literal">upsd</code> CLI options
  to only choose one, and to OS abilities). This use-case may be practically
  implemented as a single IPv6 socket on systems with enabled and required
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 address support, or as two separate listening sockets -
  logged messages to this effect (e.g. inability to listen on IPv4 after
  opening IPv6) are expected on some platforms. End-users may also want to
  reconfigure their <code class="literal">upsd.conf</code> files to remove some now-redundant <code class="literal">LISTEN</code>
