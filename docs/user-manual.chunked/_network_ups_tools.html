suggestions to rename the project. The old name no longer accurately described
it, and it was perilously close to APC’s "Smart-UPS" trademark. Rather than
risk problems in the future, the name was changed. Kern Sibbald provided the
winner: Network UPS Tools, which captures the essence of the project and makes
for great short tarball filenames: nut-x.y.z.tar.gz.</p><p>The new name was first applied to 0.42.0, released October 31, 1999.
This is also when the web pages moved from the old
<code class="literal">http://www.exploits.org/~rkroll/smartupstools/</code> URL to the replacement
at <code class="literal">http://www.exploits.org/nut/</code> to coincide with the name change.</p><p>More drivers were written and the hardware support continued to grow. upsmon
picked up the concepts of what is now known as "primary" and "secondary",
and could now handle environments where multiple systems get power from a
single UPS.</p><p>Manager mode was added to allow changing the value of read/write variables
in certain UPS models.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_june_2001_common_driver_core"></a>June 2001: common driver core</h4></div></div></div><p>Up to this point, all of the drivers compiled into freestanding programs, each
providing their own implementation of main(). This meant they all had to check
the incoming arguments and act uniformly. Unfortunately, not all of the
programs behaved the same way, and it was hard to document and use consistently.
It also meant that startup scripts had to be edited depending on what kind of
hardware was attached.</p><p>Starting in 0.45.0, released June 11, 2001, there was a new common core for
all drivers called <code class="literal">main.c</code>. It provided the main function and called back to
the <code class="literal">upsdrv_*</code> functions provided by the hardware-specific part of the drivers.
This allowed driver authors to focus on the UPS hardware without worrying about
the housekeeping stuff that needs to happen.</p><p>This new design provided an obvious way to configure drivers from one file, and
so <code class="literal">ups.conf</code> was born. This eventually spawned upsdrvctl, and now all drivers
based on this common core could be started or stopped with one command. Startup
scripts now could contain "upsdrvctl start", and it didn’t matter what kind of
hardware or how many UPSes you had on one system.</p><p>Interestingly, at the end of this month, Arnaud Quette entered the UPS world,
as a subcontractor of the now defunct MGE UPS SYSTEMS. This marked the start of
a future successful collaboration.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_may_2002_casting_off_old_drivers_iana_port_towards_1_0"></a>May 2002: casting off old drivers, IANA port, towards 1.0</h4></div></div></div><p>During the 0.45.x series, both the old standalone drivers and the ones which
had been converted to the common core were released together. Before the
release of 0.50.0 on May 24, 2002, all of the old drivers were removed.
While this shrank the list of supported hardware, it set the precedent for
removing code which isn’t receiving regular maintenance. The assumption is
that the code will be brought back up to date by someone if they actually
need it. Otherwise, it’s just dead weight in the tree.</p><p>This change meant that all remaining drivers could be controlled with the
<code class="literal">upsdrvctl</code> and <code class="literal">ups.conf</code>, allowing the documentation to be greatly
simplified. There was no longer any reason to say "do this, unless you
have this driver, then do this".</p><p>IANA granted an official port number to the project, and the network code
switched to port 3493. It had previously been on 3305 which is assigned to
<code class="literal">odette-ftp</code>. 3305 was probably picked in 1997 because it was the fifth
project to spawn from some common UDP server code.</p><p>After 0.50.1, the 0.99 tree was created to provide a tree which would receive
nothing but bug fixes in preparation for the release of 1.0. As it turned out,
very few things required fixing, and there were only three releases in this
tree.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
