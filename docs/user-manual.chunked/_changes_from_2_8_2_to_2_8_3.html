NUT development snapshots can now have more version components than the
  standard semantic versioning triplet, optionally adding the amount of
  commits on the development trunk since previous release, and the amount
  of commits on a feature branch that are unique to it.  Release artifacts
  that have zeroes in both positions would have them stripped and still
  have the standard "semver" exposed, but the development snapshots can
  now be more reasonably upgraded with automated tooling. A copy of the
  current version information would be embedded into "dist" archives as
  a <code class="literal">VERSION_DEFAULT</code> file, so it can be used without git. Certain distros
  can benefit from a <code class="literal">VERSION_FORCED</code> file or a <code class="literal">NUT_VERSION_FORCED</code>
  environment variable exported from their build system, e.g. via
  <code class="literal">echo NUT_VERSION_FORCED=1.1.1 &gt; VERSION_FORCED</code>. Unfortunately, some
  appliances tag all software the same with their firmware version;
  if this is required, a (NUT_)VERSION_FORCED_SEMVER envvar or file can
  help identify the actual NUT release version triplet used on the box.
  Please use it, it immensely helps with community troubleshooting!
  Documentation about this would be maintained in <code class="literal">docs/nut-versioning.adoc</code>
