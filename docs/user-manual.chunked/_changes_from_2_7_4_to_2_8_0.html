Note to distribution packagers: this version hopefully learns from many
  past mistakes, so many custom patches may be no longer needed. If some
  remain, please consider making pull requests for upstream NUT codebase
  to share the fixes consistently across the ecosystem. Also note that
  some new types of drivers (so package groups with unique dependencies)
  could have appeared since your packaging was written (e.g. with modbus),
  as well as new features in systemd integration (<code class="literal">nut-driver@instances</code>
  and the <code class="literal">nut-driver-enumerator</code> to manage their population), as well as
  updated Python 2 and Python 3 support (again, maybe dictating different
  package groups) as detailed below.

Due to changes needed to resolve build warnings, mostly about mismatching
  data types for some variables, some structure definitions and API signatures
  of several routines had to be changed for argument types, return types,
  or both. Primarily this change concerns internal implementation details
  (may impact update of NUT forks with custom drivers using those), but a
  few changes also happened in header files installed for builds configured
  <code class="literal">--with-dev</code> and so may impact <code class="literal">upsclient</code> and <code class="literal">nutclient</code> (C++) consumers.
  At the very least, binaries for those consumers should be rebuilt to remain
  stable with NUT 2.8.0 and not mismatch int-type sizes and other arguments.

libusb-1.0: NUT now defaults to building against libusb-1.0 API version

apcupsd-ups: When monitoring a remote apcupsd server, interpret "SHUTTING

Packagers: the AsciiDoc detection has been reworked to allow NUT to be built
  from source without requiring asciidoc/a2x (using pre-built man pages from

snmp-ups: detection of Net-SNMP has been updated to use <code class="literal">pkg-config</code> by
  default (if present), rather than <code class="literal">net-snmp-config(-32|-64)</code> script(s) as

  of options (sometimes platform-specific) in suggested <code class="literal">CFLAGS</code> and <code class="literal">LIBS</code>
  compared to the packaged <code class="literal">pkg-config</code> information which also works and is
  more portable. If this change bites your distribution, please bring it up
  in <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues" target="_top">https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues</a> or better yet, post a PR.
  Also note that <code class="literal">./configure --with-netsnmp-config(=yes)</code> should set up the
  preference of the detected script over <code class="literal">pkg-config</code> information, if both
  are available, and <code class="literal">--with-netsnmp-config=/path/name</code> would as well.

snmp-ups: bit mask values for flags in earlier codebase were defined in a
  way that caused logically different items to have same numeric values.
  This was fixed to surely use different definitions (so changing numbers

  hardware which was available did not expose any practical differences.

NUT-Monitor (desktop UI client) got separated into two projects:
    one with support for Python2 and GTK2, and another for Python3 and Qt5.
    On operating systems that serve both environments, either of these
    implementation should be usable. For distributions that deprecated
    and removed Python2 support, it is a point to consider in NUT packages
    and their build-time and installation dependencies.
    The historic filenames for desktop integration (<code class="literal">NUT-Monitor</code> script
    and <code class="literal">nut-monitor.desktop</code>) are still delivered, but now cover a wrapper
    script which detects the environment capabilities and launches the best
    suitable UI implementation (if both are available).
