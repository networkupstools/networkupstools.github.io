August 19, 2002. This milestone meant that all of the base features that
you would expect to find were intact: good hardware support, a network
server with security controls, and system shutdowns that worked.</p><p>The design was showing signs of wear from the rapid expansion, but this was
intentionally ignored for the moment. The focus was on getting a good version
out that would provide a reasonable base while the design issues could be
addressed in the future, and I’m confident that we succeeded.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_november_2002_second_stable_tree_nut_1_2_0"></a>November 2002: second stable tree: NUT 1.2.0</h4></div></div></div><p>One day after the release of 1.0.0, 1.1.0 started the new development tree.
During that development cycle, the CGI programs were rewritten to use template
files instead of hard-coded HTML, thus bringing back the flexibility of the
original unreleased prototype from 5 years before. The <code class="literal">multimon</code> was removed
from the tree, as the new <code class="literal">upsstats</code> could do both jobs by loading different
templates.</p><p>A new client library called upsclient was created, and it replaced upsfetch.
This new library only supported TCP connections, and used an opaque context
struct to keep state for each connection. As a result, client programs could
now do things that used multiple connections without any conflicts. This was
done primarily to allow OpenSSL support, but there were other benefits from
the redesign.</p><p>upsd and the clients could now use OpenSSL for basic authentication and
encryption, but this was not included by default. This was provided as
a bonus feature for those users who cared to read about it and enable
the option, as the initial setup was complex.</p><p>After the 1.1 tree was frozen and deemed complete, it became the second
stable tree with the release of 1.2.0 on November 5, 2002.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_april_2003_new_naming_scheme_better_driver_glue_and_an_overhauled_protocol"></a>April 2003: new naming scheme, better driver glue, and an overhauled protocol</h4></div></div></div><p>Following an extended period with no development tree, 1.3.0 got things
moving again on April 13, 2003. The focus of this tree was to rewrite
the driver-server communication layer and replace the static naming
scheme for variables and commands.</p><p>Up to this point, all variables had names like STATUS, UTILITY, and OUTVOLT.
They had been created as drivers were added to the tree, and there was little
consistency. For example, it probably should have been INVOLT and OUTVOLT,
but there was no OUTVOLT originally, so UTILITY was all we had. This same
pattern repeated with ACFREQ — is it incoming or outgoing? — and many more.</p><p>To solve this problem, all variables and commands were renamed to a
hierarchical scheme that had obvious grouping. STATUS became ups.status.
UTILITY turned into input.voltage, and OUTVOLT is output.voltage.
ACFREQ is input.frequency, and the new output.frequency is also now
supported. Every other variable or command was renamed in this fashion.</p><p>These variables had been shared between the drivers and upsd as values.
That is, for each name like STATUS, there was a #define somewhere in the
tree with an INFO_ prefix that gave it a number. INFO_STATUS was 0x0006,
INFO_UTILITY was 0x0004, and so on, with each name having a matching number.
This number was stored in an int within a structure which was part of the
array that was either written to disk or shared memory.</p><p>That structure had several restrictions on expansion and was dropped as the
data sharing method between the drivers and the server. It was replaced by
a new system of text-based messages over Unix domain sockets. Drivers now
accepted a short list of commands from upsd, and would push out updates
asynchronously. upsd no longer had to poll the state files or shared memory.
It could just select all of the driver and client fds and act on events.</p><p>At the same time, the network protocol on port 3493 was overhauled to take
advantage of the new naming scheme. The existing "REQ STATUS@su700",
"ANS <a class="ulink" href="mailto:STATUS@su700" target="_top">STATUS@su700</a> OL" scheme was showing signs of age, and it really
only supported the UPS name (@su700) as an afterthought. The new protocol
would now use commands like GET and LIST, leading to exchanges like
"GET VAR su700 ups.status" and "VAR su700 ups.status OL". These responses
contain enough data to stand alone, so clients can now handle them
asynchronously.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_july_2003_third_stable_tree_nut_1_4_0"></a>July 2003: third stable tree: NUT 1.4.0</h4></div></div></div><p>On July 25, 2003, 1.4.0 was released. It contained support for both the
old "REQ" style protocol (with names like STATUS), and the new "GET" style
protocol (with names like ups.status). This tree is provided to bridge the
gap between all of the old releases and the upcoming 2.0.</p><p>2.0 will be released without support for the old REQ/STATUS protocol.
The hope is that client authors and those who have implemented their own
monitoring software will use the 1.4 cycle to change to the new protocol.
The 1.4 releases contain a lot of compatibility code to make sure both
work at the same time.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_july_2003_pushing_towards_2_0"></a>July 2003: pushing towards 2.0</h4></div></div></div><p>1.5.0 forked from 1.4.0 and was released on July 29, 2003. The first changes
were to throw out anything which was providing compatibility with the older
versions of the software. This means that 1.5 and the eventual 2.0 will not
talk to anything older than 1.4.</p><p>This tree continues to evolve with new serial routines for the drivers which
are intended to replace the aging upscommon code which dates back to the early
0.x releases. The original routines would call alarm and read in a tight loop
while fetching characters. The new functions are much cleaner, and wait for
data with select. This makes for much cleaner code and easier strace/ktrace
logs, since the number of syscalls has been greatly reduced.</p><p>There has also been a push to make sure the data from the UPS is well-formed
and is actually usable before sending updates out to upsd. This started
during 1.3 as drivers were adapted to use the dstate functions and the
new variable/command names. Some drivers which were not converted to the
new naming scheme or didn’t do sanity checks on the incoming UPS data from
the serial port were dropped from the tree.</p><p>This tree was released as 2.0.0.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
