tasks such as a battery test (beware that with a worn-out battery whose
replacement is a few years overdue, a "capacity/remaining runtime" test can
still be destructive by powering off the load abruptly — and also such a
test can cause hosts to hide into graceful shutdowns when the battery state
does get critical as part of the test).

The drivers, server, and monitoring client (upsmon) can all run as separate

Only one tiny part of one program has root powers.
upsmon starts as root and forks an unprivileged process which does the actual
monitoring over the network.
They remain connected over a pipe. When a shutdown is necessary, a single
character is sent to the privileged process. It then calls the predefined
shutdown command. In any other case, the privileged process exits.

and a single <code class="literal">upsmon</code> (as a primary for both UPS 1 and UPS 2)</p><p>This software understands that some of these servers can also run with
some of the supplies gone. For this reason, every UPS is assigned a
"power value" — the quantity of power supplies that it feeds on this
system.</p><p>The total available "power value" is compared to the minimum that is
required for that hardware. For example, if you have 3 power supplies

    platforms (for fancy GUI clients, see <a class="ulink" href="../man/NUT-Monitor.html" target="_top">NUT-Monitor(8)</a> or third-party

    there are other known imperfections (not all WIN32 code has equivalents to
    POSIX); for current details see NUT issues tracked on GitHub under

Other features, such as USB / SNMP / whatever, will also need extra software

it a point to have current NUT building and running anywhere, especially
where older releases did work before (including "abandonware" like the

outages, please consider sponsoring or at least "starring" it on GitHub at
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/" target="_top">https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/</a> - these stars are among metrics
which the larger potential sponsors consider when choosing how to help
FOSS projects. Keeping the lights shining in such a large non-regression

of both core code (drivers and other features), build recipes and other
integration elements to make it work on your favourite system, documentation
revisions to make it more accessible to newcomers, as well as hardware vendor
cooperation with first-hand driver and protocol submissions, and just about
anything else you can think of.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_nut_support_policy_2"></a>NUT Support Policy</h4></div></div></div><p>The Network UPS Tools project is a community-made open-source effort, primarily
made and maintained by people donating their spare time.</p><p>The support channels are likewise open, with preferred ones being
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues" target="_top">the NUT project issue
tracker on GitHub</a> and the NUT Users mailing list, as detailed at
<a class="ulink" href="https://networkupstools.org/support.html" target="_top">https://networkupstools.org/support.html</a> page.</p><p>Please keep in mind that any help is provided by community members just like
yourself, as a best effort, and subject to their availability and experience.
It is expected that you have read the Frequently Asked Questions, looked at
the <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/wiki" target="_top">NUT wiki</a>, and have a
good grasp about the three-layer design and programs involved in a running
deployment of NUT, for a discussion to be constructive and efficient.</p><p>Be patient, polite, and prepare to learn and provide information about your
NUT deployment (version, configuration, OS…) and the device, to collect
logs, and to answer any follow-up questions about your situation.</p><p>Finally, note that NUT is packaged and delivered by packaging into numerous
operating systems, appliances and monitoring projects, and may be bundled
with third-party GUI clients.  It may be wise of end-users to identify such
cases and ask for help on the most-relevant forum (or several, including the
NUT support channels).  It is important to highlight that the NUT project
releases have for a long time been essentially snapshots of better-tested
code, and we do not normally issue patches to "hot-fix" any older releases.</p><p>Any improvements of NUT itself are made in the current code base, same as
any other feature development, so to receive desired fixes on your system
(and/or to check that they do solve your particular issue), expect to be
asked to build the recent development iteration from GitHub or work with
your appliance vendor to get a software upgrade.</p><p>Over time, downstream OS packaging or other integrations which use NUT, may
issue patches as new package revisions, or new baseline versions of NUT,
according to <span class="strong"><strong>their</strong></span> release policies. It is not uncommon for distributions,
especially "stable" flavours, to be a few years behind upstream projects.</p></div></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
