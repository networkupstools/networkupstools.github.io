Packagers have done an excellent and hard work at improving NUT integration
into their operating system.  On the other hand, distributions and appliances
tend to package "official releases" of projects such as NUT, and so do not
deliver latest and greatest fixes, new drivers, bugs and other features.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="Installing_source"></a>5.1. Installing from source</h3></div></div></div><p>These are the essential steps for compiling and installing this software
from distribution archives (usually "release tarballs") which include a
pre-built copy of the <code class="literal">configure</code> script and some other generated source
files.</p><p>To build NUT from a Git checkout you may need some additional tools
(referenced just a bit below) and run <code class="literal">./autogen.sh</code> to generate the
needed files. For common developer iterations, porting to new platforms,
or in-place testing, running the <code class="literal">./ci_build.sh</code> script can be helpful.

device files can change randomly. To set up the correct

which try their best to discover the configuration of an earlier build
(configuration and run-time paths and OS accounts involved, maybe an
exact configuration if stored in deployed binaries).</p><p>This optional mode is primarily intended for several use-cases:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Test recent GitHub "master" branch or a proposed PR to see if it
  solves a practical problem for a particular user;
</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Replace an existing deployment, e.g. if OS-provided packages deliver
  obsolete code, to use newer NUT locally in "production mode".
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem">
In such cases ideally get your distribution, NAS vendor, etc.
    to provide current NUT — and benefit from a better integrated
    and tested product.
</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>Note that "just testing" often involves building the codebase and new
drivers or tools in question, and running them right from the build
workspace (without installing into the system and so risking an
unpredictable-stability state). In case of testing new driver builds,
note that you would need to stop the normally running instances to
free up the communications resources (USB/serial ports, etc.), run the
new driver program in data-dump mode, and restart the normal systems
operations.</p><p>Such tests still benefit from matching the build configuration to what
is already deployed, in order to request same configuration files and
system access permissions (e.g. to own device nodes for physical-media
ports involved, and to read the production configuration files).</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_pre_requisites"></a>Pre-requisites</h5></div></div></div><p>The <a class="link" href="apk.html" title="K. Prerequisites for building NUT on different OSes">Prerequisites for building NUT on different OSes</a>
document details tools and dependencies that were added on NUT CI build
environments, which now cover many operating systems. This should
provide a decent starting point for the build on yours (PRs to update
the document are welcome!)</p><p>Note that unlike distribution tarballs, Git sources do not include a
<code class="literal">configure</code> script and some other files — these should be generated by
running <code class="literal">autogen.sh</code> (or <code class="literal">ci_build.sh</code> that calls it).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_getting_the_right_sources"></a>Getting the right sources</h5></div></div></div><p>To build the current tip of development iterations (usually after PR
merges that passed CI, reviews and/or other tests), just clone the NUT
repository and "master" branch should get checked out by default (also
can request that explicitly, per example posted below).</p><p>If you want to quickly test a particular pull request, see the link on
top of the PR page that says <code class="literal">... wants to merge ... from : ...</code> and
copy the proposed-source URL of that "from" part.</p><p>For example, in some PR this says <code class="literal">jimklimov:issue-1234</code> and links to
<code class="literal">https://github.com/jimklimov/nut/tree/issue-1234</code>.
For manual git-cloning, just paste that URL into the shell and replace
the <code class="literal">/tree/</code> with "<code class="literal">-b</code>" CLI option for branch selection, like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">:; cd /tmp
### Checkout https://github.com/jimklimov/nut/tree/issue-1234

settings, in this case primarily to default the choice of drivers to
auto-detection of what can be built, and to skip building documentation.
Also note that this script supports many other scenarios for CI and
developers, managed by <code class="literal">BUILD_TYPE</code> and other environment variables,
which are not explored here.</p></div><p>An "in-place" <span class="emphasis"><em>testing</em></span> build and run would probably go along these lines:</p><pre class="literallayout">:; cd /tmp

local builds, you may want to have precise control over <code class="literal">configure</code>
options (e.g. choice of required drivers, or enabled documentation).</p><p>A sound starting point would be to track down packaging recipes used by
your distribution (e.g.
<a class="ulink" href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nut/blob/rawhide/f/nut.spec" target="_top">RPM spec</a>
or
<a class="ulink" href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/nut/-/blob/debian/debian/rules" target="_top">DEB rules</a>
files, etc.) to detail the same paths if you intend to replace those,
and copy the parameters for <code class="literal">configure</code> script from there — especially
if your system is not currently running NUT v2.8.1 or newer (which embeds
this information to facilitate in-place upgrade rebuilds).</p><p>Note that the primary focus of in-place automated configuration mode is
about critical run-time options, such as OS user accounts, configuration
location and state/PID paths, so it alone might not replace your driver
binaries that the package would put into an obscure location like
<code class="literal">/lib/nut</code>. It would however install init-scripts or systemd units that
would refer to new locations specified by the current build, so such old
binaries would just consume disk space but not run.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_replacing_any_nut_deployment"></a>Replacing any NUT deployment</h5></div></div></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>For deployments on OSes with <code class="literal">systemd</code> see the next section.</p></div><p>This goes similar to usual build and install from Git:</p><pre class="literallayout">:; cd /tmp

:; cd nut
:; ./autogen.sh
:; ./configure --enable-inplace-runtime # --maybe-some-other-options
:; make -j 4 all &amp;&amp; make -j 4 check &amp;&amp; sudo make install</pre><p>Note that <code class="literal">make install</code> does not currently handle all the nuances that
packaging installation scripts would, such as customizing filesystem
object ownership, daemon restarts, etc. or even creating locations like
<code class="literal">/var/state/ups</code> and <code class="literal">/var/run/nut</code> as part of the <code class="literal">make</code> target (but
e.g. the delivered <code class="literal">systemd-tmpfiles</code> configuration can handle that for
a large part of the audience). This aspect is tracked as
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1298" target="_top">issue #1298</a></p><p>At this point you should revise the locations for PID files
(e.g. <code class="literal">/var/run/nut</code>) and pipe files (e.g. <code class="literal">/var/state/ups</code>) that they
exist and permissions remain suitable for NUT run-time user selected by
your configuration, and typically stop your original NUT drivers,
data-server (upsd) and upsmon, and restart them using the new binaries.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_replacing_a_systemd_enabled_nut_deployment"></a>Replacing a systemd-enabled NUT deployment</h5></div></div></div><p>For modern Linux distributions with <code class="literal">systemd</code> this replacement procedure

from 2.7.4 and older releases, through 2.8.0, and up to current codebase.
Most of the NUT units are now <code class="literal">WantedBy=nut.target</code> (which is in turn
<code class="literal">WantedBy=multi-user.target</code> and so bound to system startup). You should
only <code class="literal">systemctl enable</code> those units you need on this system — this allows

a much older codebase (using NUT v2.6.5 as a baseline). While the current
state of the codebase you are looking at aims to refresh the effort of
delivering NUT on Windows, the aim at the moment is to help developers
build and modernize it after a decade of blissful slumber, and packages
are not being regularly produced yet. Functionality of such builds varies
a lot depending on build environment used. This effort is generally
tracked at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/orgs/networkupstools/projects/2/views/1" target="_top">https://github.com/orgs/networkupstools/projects/2/views/1</a>
and help would be welcome!</p><p>It should currently be possible to build the codebase in native Windows
with MSYS2/MinGW and cross-building from Linux with mingw (preferably
in a Debian/Ubuntu container). Refer to
<a class="ulink" href="config-prereqs.txt" target="_top">Prerequisites for building NUT on different OSes</a>
and <a class="ulink" href="scripts/Windows/README" target="_top">scripts/Windows/README file</a> for respective

be located in same directory as each EXE file that uses them. This can be
accomplished for FOSS libraries (copying them from the build environment)
by calling <code class="literal">make install-win-bundle DESTDIR=/some/valid/location</code> easily.</p><p>Archives with binaries built by recent iterations of continuous integration
jobs should be available for exploration on the respective CI platforms.</p></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Information below may be currently obsolete, but the NUT project wishes
