MGE UPS SYSTEMS was the previous NUT sponsor, from 2002 until its partial
acquisition by Eaton. They provided protocols information, many units for
development of NUT-related projects.
Several drivers such as mge-utalk, mge-shut, snmp-ups, hidups, and usbhid-ups
are the result of this collaboration, in addition to the WMNut, MGE HID Parser
the libhid projects, … through Arnaud Quette (who was also an MGE employee).
All the MGE supporters have gone with Eaton (through MGE Office Protection
Systems), which was temporarily the new NUT sponsor.

Fenton Technologies contributed a PowerPal 660 to the project.  Their open
stance and quick responses to technical inquiries were appreciated for
making the development of the fentonups driver possible.
Fenton has since been acquired by <a class="ulink" href="http://www.metapo.com" target="_top">Metapo</a>.
</li><li class="listitem">
Bo Kersey of <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vircio.com" target="_top">VirCIO</a> provided a Best Power
Fortress 750 to facilitate the bestups driver.
</li><li class="listitem">
Invensys Energy Systems provided the SOLA/Best "Phoenixtec" protocol
document. SOLA has since been acquired by Eaton.
</li><li class="listitem">
PowerKinetics technical support provided documentation on their MiniCOL
protocol, which is archived in the NUT protocol library.
PowerKinetics was acquired by the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.jst.cc" target="_top">JST Group</a>
in June 2003.
</li><li class="listitem">
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cyberpowersystems.com" target="_top">Cyber Power Systems</a> contributed a
700AVR model for testing and development of the cyberpower driver.

<a class="ulink" href="http://www.liebert.com" target="_top">Liebert Corporation</a> supplied serial test boxes
and a UPStation GXT2 with the Web/SNMP card for development of the liebert
driver and expansion of the existing snmp-ups driver.
Liebert has since been acquired by <a class="ulink" href="http://www.emerson.com" target="_top">Emerson</a>.

have enough information about the situation. Developers are kindly requested

help, as well as convey a sense of official support (at least, that drivers
were proposed according to the know-how coming from specs and knowledge about
hardware and firmware capabilities, and not acquired via reverse engineering
with a certain degree of unreliability and incompleteness). If we have left
