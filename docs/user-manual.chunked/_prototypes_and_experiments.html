    Plan:
    Welcome to the UPS monitor service at kadets.d20.co.edu.
    The Smart-UPS attached to kadets generated a report at 14:24:01 on 05/17/96.
    During the measured period, the following data points were taken:
    Voltage ranged from 115.0 VAC to 116.3 VAC.
    The UPS generated 116.3 VAC at 60.00 Hz.
    The battery level was at 27.60 volts.
    The load placed on the UPS was 024.9 percent.
    UPS temperature was measured at 045.0 degrees Celsius.
    Measurements are taken every 10 minutes by the upsd daemon.
    This report is generated by a script written by Russell Kroll&lt;rkroll@kadets&gt;.
    Modified for compatibility with the BSD/OS cron daemon by Neil Schroeder</pre><p>This same status data could also be seen with a web browser, since we
had rigged up a CGI wrapper script which called finger.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_january_1997_initial_protocol_tests"></a>January 1997: initial protocol tests</h4></div></div></div><p>Initial tests with a freestanding non-daemon program provided a few
basic status registers from the UPS. The 940-0024C cable was not yet
understood, so this happened over the [attachment:apcevilhack.jpg evil

the UPS (APC Smart models only) and communicated with upsc by sending
binary structures in UDP datagrams.</p><p>The first CGI interface existed, but it was all implemented with shell
scripts. The main script would call upsc to retrieve status values. Then
it would cat a template file through sed to plug them into the page.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/old-cgi.png" alt="Old CGI screenshot" /></div></div><p>upsstats actually has since returned to using templates, despite having
a period in the middle when it used hardcoded HTML.</p><p>The images were also created with shell scripts. Each script would call
upsc to get the right value (utility, upsload, battcap). It then took
the value, plugged it into a command file with sed, and passed that into

fly actually uses gd, just like upsimage does today.</p><p>This code later evolved into Smart UPS Tools 0.10.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
