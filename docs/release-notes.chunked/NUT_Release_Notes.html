development iterations of NUT should now identify with not only the

introduced a check for daemons working with PID files to double-check
     that if they can resolve the program name of a running process with
     this identifier, that such name matches the current program (avoid
     failures to start NUT daemons if PID files are on persistent storage,
     and some unrelated program got that PID after a reboot).  This might
     introduce regressions for heavily customized NUT builds (e.g. those
     embedded in NAS or similar devices) where binary file names differ
     significantly from a <code class="literal">progname</code> string defined in the respective NUT
     source file, so a boolean <code class="literal">NUT_IGNORE_CHECKPROCNAME</code> environment
     variable support was added to optionally disable this verification.
     Also the NUT daemons should request to double-check against their

   UPS devices over TCP and Serial connections, as well as USB with a patched
   libmodbus (check <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/EchterAgo/libmodbus/commits/rtu_usb" target="_top">https://github.com/EchterAgo/libmodbus/commits/rtu_usb</a>

For a decade until this driver got introduced, people were advised to
     use apcupsd project as the actual program which talks to a device, and
     NUT apcupsd-ups driver to relay information back and forth. This was a
     limited solution due to lack of command and variable setting support,
     as well as relaying of just some readings (just whatever apcupsd exposes,
     further constrained by what our driver knows to re-translate), with
     little leverage for NUT to tap into everything the device has to offer.
     There were also issues on some systems due to packaging (e.g. marking
     NUT and apcupsd as competing implementations of the same features) which
     required clumsy workarounds to get both installed and running. Finally,
     there is a small matter of long-term viability of that approach: last
     commits to apcupsd sources were in 2017 (with last release 3.14.14 in

   Arnaud Quette (NUT project leader) has taken over NUT hosting on his own,
   to give NUT back some independence.
  
  
   This effort is also part of a logic to stop crediting Eaton for
   contributions from others (especially Arnaud Quette, as an individual).
   The new hosting service is located, as for Arnaud’s blog

This release fixes an important vulnerability in upsd
   (CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed)
  
  
   NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3, are exposed to
   crashes when receiving random data from the network.
  
  
   This issue is related to the way NUT parses characters,
   especially from the network. Non printable characters were missed
   from strings operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the
   buffer, causing an overflow.
  
  
   Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset of ASCII charset from
   <code class="literal">Space</code> to <code class="literal">~</code>
   (Reported by Sebastian Pohle, Alioth bug <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/313636" target="_top">#313636</a>, CVE-2012-2944)

The new naming scheme for variables and commands (introduced in 1.4)
   is now mandatory.  The 1.4 tree supported both the old (STATUS) and
   the new (ups.status) as a transitional release, and now that time is
   over.
  
  
   This means that 2.0 is generally smaller than 1.4 code, since the
   interim compatibility hacks have been removed.
</li><li class="listitem">
New serial handling code has been added, with greatly simplified
   operations.  The old mess involving repeated calls to sigaction,
   alarm, and read has been condensed to a select-read loop.
  
  
   This change allows drivers which don’t do any serial communications
   at all (hidups, snmp-ups) to drop that baggage, so they are a bit
   smaller when compiled.
</li><li class="listitem">
The drivers now recognize "chroot=' and <span class="emphasis"><em>user=</em></span> in the global section
   of ups.conf.  This means you don’t have to use -r and -u when
   starting upsdrvctl.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsmon now supports the -K argument to check for the presence of the
   POWERDOWNFLAG file.  If it exists and contains the magic string, then
   upsmon will exit(EXIT_SUCCESS).  Otherwise, it will
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE).
  
  
   This feature can be used to simplify shutdown scripts, since now you
   don’t have to keep the script in sync with the upsmon.conf.
</li><li class="listitem">
Many small things like signed value comparisons, int vs. size_t and
   proper use of const/struct were fixed throughout the source.  These
   were mostly for correctness, but a few potential bugs involving very
   big or very small numbers were fixed at the same time.
</li><li class="listitem">
The access control system in upsd.conf has been reworked and
   simplified.  Since access levels have become meaningless in recent
   releases, the new system is just ACCEPT &lt;acl&gt; or REJECT &lt;acl&gt;.
  
  
   If you are upgrading from a previous version of the software, you
   will have to edit your upsd.conf to use this method.  See
   the <a class="ulink" href="UPGRADING.adoc" target="_top">UPGRADING.adoc</a> file for more details.

</li><li class="listitem">
The newapc driver has been renamed to apcsmart, replacing the old
   driver with that name. If you used the newapc driver, be sure to
   delete the old binary and fix your ups.conf.
</li><li class="listitem">
The apcsmart driver now supports asynchronous notification data
   from the hardware, which means it can wake up as soon as something
   happens.  This affects the OL/OB/LB/RB data in ups.status, and
   generally reduces the latency in dispatching status changes by a few
   seconds.
</li><li class="listitem">
The apcsmart driver can now support quirky hardware which does not
   provide the usual listing of valid command characters.  This feature
   is necessary to monitor new models like the APC CS 350 and old ones
   like the Matrix 5000.  It also now has sdtype=4 to handle the strange
   shutdown behavior on the CS series.
</li><li class="listitem">
The belkin driver now works around broken firmware version 001,
   avoiding a lengthy delay at startup.  It also implements the shutdown
   sequence differently, and should actually work on more hardware now.
</li><li class="listitem">
The bestups driver has been slowed down to play nicer with the
   hardware, and is much more reliable as a result.  Among other things,
   it should always detect the UPS on the first try, meaning no more
   "dot dot dot" when it starts.
</li><li class="listitem">
The cyberpower driver is no longer tagged experimental, and now
   supports powering off the load.  It also supports battery tests via

The drivers and upsd now communicate over Unix domain sockets instead
   of state files, shared memory, or state files with mmap.  This change
   makes many things possible, including the new dynamic variable and
   command naming scheme described below.
  
  
   There is a new development tool called sockdebug in the server
   directory for debugging driver-server communications on the sockets.
</li><li class="listitem">
The old static variable scheme has been replaced by a new dynamic
   implementation.  Vague names have been turned into meaningful names
   that fit into an organized system.  UTILITY is now input.voltage.
   OUTVOLT is now output.voltage.
  
  
   This also applies to the names of instant commands.  BTEST1 is
   test.battery.start, and BTEST0 is test.battery.stop.
  
  
   The old names are still supported for compatibility with older
   clients.  This compatibility mode will be maintained throughout
   the 1.4 series, and will be gone by the release of 2.0.  Users
   with older clients are encouraged to upgrade their software
   during this time.
</li><li class="listitem">
The network protocol has been expanded to handle these new names.
   Older functions which only apply to the old names will continue to
   be supported through the 1.4 series.
</li><li class="listitem">
The drivers and server (upsd) can now change their user ids and
   chroot themselves with the new -u and -r arguments.  This lets you
   create a "chroot jail" with the bare minimum components.
  
  
   This technique is used to provide a higher degree of security.  If
   someone exploited upsd to get a shell somehow, they would be stuck
   in the jail.
</li><li class="listitem">
upssched now explicitly confirms reception of timer commands before
   exiting.  This was done to avoid a race where one process would
   exit right when another one was starting.  The second one would
   believe its command had been handled when it had been lost.
</li><li class="listitem">
upslog has been reworked to use standard getopt parsing to provide
   the monitoring settings.  The old way of specifying arguments is
   still supported for backwards compatibility.
  
  
   upslog has also been changed to only parse the format string once,
   rather than doing it every time through the loop.  This should
   provide a minuscule drop in CPU utilization.
</li><li class="listitem">
Usernames are now required in upsmon and upsd.  This means that you
   must add a username to your MONITOR lines in upsmon.conf and then
   create a matching user in upsd.users.
  
  
   Installations from the 1.2 era probably already used usernames, so
   this mostly affects those from 1.0 and before.
</li><li class="listitem">
Drivers are now pinged regularly by upsd when they aren’t posting
   updates about the UPS status.  This provides another check in the
   data validation process.  If upsd fails to get a response within
   a few seconds, the UPS will be marked stale.
</li><li class="listitem">
A few minor memory leaks were discovered with valgrind and squashed.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsstats now reuses connections to upsd when cycling through multiple
   entries in the hosts.conf.  This makes things a bit faster and
   avoids some of the noise in the syslog.
  
  
   This only applies to entries that are adjacent.  To take advantage
   of this feature, you may have to rearrange them per example below.
  
  
   Connection reuse for nonadjacent entries may be considered in the
   future.

upsd now warns about insecure configuration files at startup.
   These files (upsd.conf, upsd.users, and the certfile) should
   only be readable by upsd.  Never make them world-readable.
</li><li class="listitem">
The programs no longer print "shutting down" when they are just
   exiting.  This was changed to avoid confusion about the term, since
   "shutting down" has a special meaning in UPS software.
</li><li class="listitem">
Signal handlers no longer do any significant amount of work.  Some of
   the programs used to do numerous things in there, raising concerns
   about reentrancy.  They now set flags and allow the main loop to do
   the actual work from there.
</li><li class="listitem">
A bug in upsmon where NOTIFYFLAG settings could be ignored was fixed.
</li><li class="listitem">
Group handling has been changed.  configure no longer accepts
   --with-group, and the programs no longer setgid() to a hardcoded
   value.  They now setgid() to the primary group of whatever the
   user value may be.
  
  
   This may be compiled in with --with-user as before, and many programs
   accept -u to override it at runtime.
</li><li class="listitem">
The state path is no longer created during <span class="emphasis"><em>make install</em></span>.  Users
   are now expected to create it themselves.  This removes a lot of
   evil complexity from the build and install sequences.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsd no longer implements the DROP access command, as it
   could confuse the clients by getting them out of sync.  DROP is now
   implemented as DENY, which sends an error message.  If you use DROP,
   you should change it to DENY rather than relying on this
   compatibility measure.
</li><li class="listitem">
The belkin driver no longer reports OFF and OL at the same time.
</li><li class="listitem">
The bestups driver no longer sleeps during polls, which makes it
   more responsive to things like instant commands.

The cyberpower driver now has much better hardware detection code
   and no longer freezes at startup under some conditions.  It also now
   supports the shutdown function.  Instant commands for shutdowns and

The dummyups testing driver has been removed.  The dummycons testing
   driver can do everything that dummyups once did and much more.
   dummycons is also now built by default for easier testing.

   [Arnaud Quette, Philippe Marzouk]
</li><li class="listitem">
Outlet-level control has been defined in the variable tree, and will
   be added to drivers where the hardware supports it.  This can be
