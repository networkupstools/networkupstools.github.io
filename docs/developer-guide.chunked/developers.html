"strict" C99 (or rather GNU99 on many systems) or newer standard.</p></div><p>The NUT codebase may build in a mode without warnings made fatal on C89
(GNU89), but the emitted warnings indicate that those binaries may crash.
By the end of 2021, NUT codebase has been revised to pass GNU and strict-C
mode builds with C89 standard with the GCC toolkit (and on systems that do
have the newer features in libraries, just hide them in standard headers);
however CLANG toolkit is more restrictive about the C99+ syntax used.
That said, some systems refuse to expose methods or types available in
their system headers and binary libraries if strict-C mode is used alone,
without extra system-specific defines to enable more than the baseline.</p><p>It was also seen that cross-builds (e.g. NUT for Windows using mingw on
Linux) may be unable to define <code class="literal">WIN32</code> and/or find symbols for linking
when using a strict-C language standard.</p><p>The C<code class="literal"> support expects C</code>11 or newer (not really configured or tested
for older C<code class="literal">98 or C</code>03), modulo features that were deprecated in later
language revisions (C++14 onwards) as highlighted by warnings from newer
compilers.</p><p>Note also that the NUT codebase currently relies on certain features,
such as the printf format modifiers for <code class="literal">(s)size_t</code>, use of <code class="literal">long long</code>,
some nuances about structure/array initializers, variadic macros for
debugging, etc. that a pedantic C90 mode compilation warns is not part
of the standard but a GNU extension (and part of C99 and newer standard
revisions). Many of the "offences" against the older standard actually
come from system and third-party header files.</p><p>That said, the NUT CI farm does run non-regression builds with GNU C89
and "strict" C89 standard revisions and minimal passing warnings level,
to ensure that codebase is and remains at least basically compliant.
We try to cover a few distributions from early 2000’s for this, either
in regular CI builds or one-off local builds for community members with
a zoo of old systems.</p><p>If somebody in the community actually requires to build and run NUT on
systems that old, where newer compilers are not available, pull requests
to fix the offending coding issues in some way that does not break other
use-cases are welcome.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_continuous_integration_and_automated_builds"></a>3.4. Continuous Integration and Automated Builds</h3></div></div></div><p>To ease and automate the build scenarios which were deemed important for
quality assurance and non-regression checks of NUT, several solutions
were introduced over time.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_build_automation_tools_and_scripts"></a>Build automation tools and scripts</h4></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_ci_build_sh"></a>ci_build.sh</h5></div></div></div><p>This script was originally introduced (following ZeroMQ/ZProject example)
to automate CI builds, by automating certain scenarios driven by exported
environment variables to set particular <code class="literal">configure</code> options and <code class="literal">make</code>
some targets (chosen by the <code class="literal">BUILD_TYPE</code> envvar). It can also be used
locally to avoid much typing to re-run those scenarios during development.</p><p>Developers can directly use the scripts involved in CI builds to fix
existing code on their workstations or to ensure support for new
compilers and C standard revisions, e.g. save a local file like this
to call the common script with pre-sets:</p><pre class="literallayout">$ cat _fightwarn-gcc10-gnu17.sh
#!/bin/sh</pre><pre class="literallayout">BUILD_TYPE=default-all-errors \
CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu17" \
CXXFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=gnu++17" \
CC=gcc-10 CXX=g++-10 \
        ./ci_build.sh</pre><p>…and then execute it to prepare a workspace, after which you can go
fixing bugs file-by-file running a <code class="literal">make</code> after each save to confirm
your solutions and uncover the next issue to address :-)</p><p>Helpfully, the NUT CI farm build logs report the configuration used for
each executed stage, so if some build combination fails — you can just
scroll to the end of that section and copy-paste the way to reproduce
an issue locally (on an OS similar to that build case).</p><p>Note that while spelling out sets of warnings can help in a quest to
fix certain bugs during development (if only by removing noise from
classes of warnings not relevant to the issue one is working on), there
is a reasonable set of warnings which NUT codebase actively tries to
be clean about (and checks in CI), detailed in the next section.</p><p>For the <code class="literal">ci_build.sh</code> usage like above, one can instead pass the setting
via <code class="literal">BUILD_WARNOPT=...</code>, and require that all emitted warnings are fatal
for their build, e.g.:</p><pre class="literallayout">$ cat _fightwarn-clang9-gnu11.sh
#!/bin/sh</pre><pre class="literallayout">BUILD_TYPE=default-all-errors \
BUILD_WARNOPT=hard BUILD_WARNFATAL=yes \
CFLAGS="-std=gnu11" \
CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11" \
CC=clang-9 CXX=clang++-9 CPP=clang-cpp \
        ./ci_build.sh</pre><p>Finally, for refactoring effort geared particularly for fighting the
warnings which exist in current codebase, the script contains some
presets (which would evolve along with codebase quality improvements)
as <code class="literal">BUILD_TYPE=fightwarn-gcc</code>, <code class="literal">BUILD_TYPE=fightwarn-clang</code> or plain
<code class="literal">BUILD_TYPE=fightwarn</code>:</p><pre class="literallayout">BUILD_TYPE=fightwarn-clang ./ci_build.sh</pre><p>As a rule of thumb, new contributions must not emit any warnings when
built in GNU99 mode with a <code class="literal">minimal</code> "difficulty" level of warnings.
Technically they must survive the part of test matrix across the several
platforms tested by NUT CI and marked in project settings as required
to pass, to be accepted for a pull request merge.</p><p>Developers aiming to post successful pull requests to improve NUT can
pass the <code class="literal">--enable-warnings</code> option to the <code class="literal">configure</code> script in local
builds to see how that behaves and ensure that at least in some set-up
their contribution is viable. Note that different compiler versions and
vendors (gcc/clang/…), building against different OS and third-party
dependencies, with different CPU architectures and different language
specification revisions, might all complain about different issues — and catching this in as diverse range of set-ups as possible is why we
have CI tests.</p><p>It can be beneficial for serial developers to set up a local BuildBot,
Travis or a Jenkins instance with a matrix test job, to test their local
git repository branches with whatever systems they have available.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

</li></ul></div><p>While <code class="literal">autoconf</code> tries its best to provide portable shell code, sometimes
there are builds of system shell that just fail under stress. If you are
seeing random failures of <code class="literal">./configure</code> script in different spots with
the same inputs, try telling <code class="literal">./ci_build.sh</code> to loop configuring until
success (instead of quickly failing), and/or tell <code class="literal">./configure</code> to use
another shell at least for the system call-outs, with options like these:</p><pre class="literallayout">SHELL=/bin/bash CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash CI_SHELL_IS_FLAKY=true \
./ci_build.sh</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="_jenkins_ci"></a>Jenkins CI</h5></div></div></div><p>Since mid-2021, the NUT CI farm is implemented by several virtual servers
courteously provided by <a class="ulink" href="http://fosshost.org" target="_top">Fosshost</a> and later by
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d2fbf2b9e082&amp;utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&amp;utm_medium=Referral_Program&amp;utm_source=badge" target="_top">DigitalOcean</a>.</p><p>These run various operating systems as build agents, and a Jenkins instance
to orchestrate the builds of NUT branches and pull requests on those agents.</p><p>This is driven by <code class="literal">Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix</code> and a Jenkins Shared Library called
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix" target="_top">jenkins-dynamatrix</a>
which prepares a matrix of builds across as many operating systems,
bitnesses/architectures, compilers, make programs and C/C++ revisions
as it can — based on the population of currently available build agents
and capabilities which they expose as agent labels.</p><p>This hopefully means that people interested in NUT can contribute to the
build farm (and ensure NUT is and remains compatible with their platform)
by running a Jenkins Swarm agent with certain labels, which would dial
into <a class="ulink" href="https://ci.networkupstools.org/" target="_top">https://ci.networkupstools.org/</a> controller. Please contact the NUT
maintainer if you want to participate in this manner.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix</code> recipe allows NUT CI farm to run different sets
of build scenarios based on various conditions, such as the name of branch
being built (or PR’ed against), changed files (e.g. C/C++ sources vs. just
docs), and some build combinations may be not required to succeed.</p><p>For example, the main development branch and pull requests against it must
cleanly pass all specified builds and tests on various platforms with the
default level of warnings specified in the <code class="literal">configure</code> script. These are
balanced to not run too many build scenarios overall, but just a quick and
sufficiently representative set.</p><p>As another example, there is special handling for "fightwarn" pattern in
the branch names to run many more builds with varying warning levels and
more variants of intermediate language revisions, and so expose concerns
deliberately missed by default warnings levels in "master" branch builds
(the bar moves over time, as some classes of warnings become extinct from
our codebase).</p><p>Further special handling for branches named like <code class="literal">fightwarn.*89.*</code> regex
enables more intensive warning levels for a GNU89 build specifically (which
are otherwise disabled as noisy yet not useful for supported C99+ builds),
and is intended to help develop fixes for support of this older language
revision, if anyone would dare.</p><p>Many of those unsuccessful build stages are precisely the focus of the
"fightwarn" effort, and are currently marked as "may fail", so they end
up as "UNSTABLE" (seen as orange bubbles in the Jenkins BlueOcean UI, or
orange cells in the tabular list of stages in the legacy UI), rather than
as "FAILURE" (red bubbles) for build scenarios that were not expected to
fail and usually represent higher-priority problems that would block a PR.</p><p>Developers whose PR builds (or attempts to fix warnings) did not succeed in
some cell of such build matrix, can look at the individual logs of that cell.
Beside indication from the compiler about the failure, the end of log text
includes the command which was executed by CI worker and can be reproduced
locally by the developer, e.g.:</p><pre class="screen">22:26:01  FINISHED with exit-code 2 cmd:  (
22:26:01  [ -x ./ci_build.sh ] || exit
22:26:01

    CPP=cpp-10 CFLAGS='-std=gnu99 -m64' CXXFLAGS='-std=gnu++11 -m64' \
    LDFLAGS='-m64' ./ci_build.sh
22:26:01  )</pre><p>or for autotools-driven scenarios (which prep, configure, build and test
in separate stages — so for reproducing a failed build you should also
look at its configuration step separately):</p><pre class="screen">22:28:18  FINISHED with exit-code 0 cmd:  ( [ -x configure ] || exit; \
    eval  CC=clang-9 CXX=clang++-9 CPP=clang-cpp-9 CFLAGS='-std=c11 -m64' \
    CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11 -m64' LDFLAGS='-m64' time ./configure )</pre><p>To re-run such scenario locally, you can copy the line from <code class="literal">eval</code> (but
without the <code class="literal">eval</code> keyword itself) up to and including the executed script

may have to tweak the <code class="literal">CC</code>, <code class="literal">CXX</code> and <code class="literal">CPP</code> arguments; note that a <code class="literal">CPP</code>
may be specified as <code class="literal">/path/to/CC -E</code> for GCC and CLANG based toolkits

fixing in this era, such as the use of <code class="literal">__func__</code> in debug commands).
If there still are practical use-cases that require builds of NUT on
pre-C99 compiler toolkits, pull requests are of course welcome — but
the maintainer team does not intend to spend much time on that.</p><p>Hopefully this warnings pre-set mechanism is extensible enough if we
would need to add more compilers and/or "difficulty levels" in the

passed through <code class="literal">CFLAGS</code> or <code class="literal">CXXFLAGS</code> values to your local <code class="literal">configure</code>
run, but it is up to your compiler how it interprets the resulting mix.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_integrated_development_environments_ides_and_debugging_nut"></a>3.5. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and debugging NUT</h3></div></div></div><p>Much of NUT has been coded using classic editors of developers' preference,

the binary you would test, and use <code class="literal">${OUTPUT_PATH}</code> variable as its name in
the "Run Command" (still likely need custom arguments) and "Symbol File" below.</p><p>When you investigate interactions of two or more programs, but only want to

and popular IDE, however it is of limited use for NUT development.</p><p>Its ecosystem does feature a good AsciiDoc plugin, Python and of course the
Java/Groovy support, so IDEA is helpful for maintenance of NUT documentation,
helper scripts and CI recipes.</p><p>It lacks however C/C++ language support (allegedly a different product in the
IntelliJ portfolio is dedicated to that), so for the core NUT project sources
it is just a fancy text editor (with <code class="literal">.editorconfig</code> support) without syntax
highlighting or codebase cross-reference aids, build/run/debug support, etc.</p><p>Still, it is possible to run builds and tests in embedded or external terminal
session — so it is not worse than editing with legacy tools, and navigation
or code-base-wide search is arguably easier.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_coding_style"></a>3.6. Coding style</h3></div></div></div><p>This is how we do things:</p><pre class="screen">int open_subspace(char *ship, int privacy)
{
        if (!privacy)
                return insecure_channel(ship);

        if (!init_privacy(ship))
                fatal_with_errno("Can't open secure channel");

        return secure_channel(ship);
}</pre><p>The basic idea is that we try to group things into functions, and then
find ways to drop out of them when we can’t go any further.  There’s
another way to program this involving a big else chunk and a bunch of
braces, and it can be hard to follow.  You can read this from top to
bottom and have a pretty good idea of what’s going on without having to
track too much <code class="literal">{ }</code> nesting and indenting.</p><p>We don’t really care for <code class="literal">pretentiousVariableNamingSchemes</code>, but you can
probably get away with it in your own driver that we will never have to
touch.  If your function or variable names start pushing important code
off the right margin of the screen, expect them to meet the byte
chainsaw sooner or later.</p><p>All types defined with typedef should end in <code class="literal">_t</code>, because this is
easier to read, and it enables tools (such as indent and emacs) to
display the source code correctly.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_indenting_with_tabs_vs_spaces"></a>Indenting with tabs vs. spaces</h4></div></div></div><p>Another thing to notice is that the indenting happens with tabs instead
of spaces.  This lets everyone have their personal tab-width setting
without inflicting much pain on other developers.  If you use a space,
then you’ve fixed the spacing in stone and have really annoyed half of
the people out there.</p><p>Note that tabs apply only to <span class="strong"><strong>indenting</strong></span>.  Alignment of text after any
non-tab character has appeared on the line must be done by spaces in
order for it to remain at the same alignment when someone views tabs at
a different widths.</p><p>One common example for this is multi-line if condition:</p><pre class="screen">        if (something &amp;&amp;
            something_else) {</pre><p>which may be written without mixing tabs and spaces to indent, as:</p><pre class="screen">        if (something
        &amp;&amp;  something_else
        ) {</pre><p>Another example is tables of definitions that are better aligned with
(non-leading) spaces at least between names and values not too many
characters wide; it still helps to align the columns with spaces at
offsets divisible by 4 or 8 (consistently for the whole table):</p><pre class="screen">#define SHORT_MACRO                         1   /* flag comment */
#define SOMETHING_WITH_A_VERY_LONG_NAME     255 /* flag comment */</pre><p>While at it, we encourage indentation of nested preprocessor macros
and pragmas, by adding a single space character for each inner level,
as well as commenting the <code class="literal">#else</code> and <code class="literal">#endif</code> parts (especially if
they are far away from their opening <code class="literal">#if</code>/<code class="literal">#ifdef</code>/<code class="literal">#ifndef</code> statement)
to help visual navigation in the source code base. Please take care to
keep the hash <code class="literal">#</code> character of the preprocessor lines in the left-most
column, since some implementations of <code class="literal">cpp</code> parser used for analysis
default to "traditional" (pre-C89) syntax shared with other languages,
and then ignore lines which do not start with the hash character (or
worse, ignore only some of them but not others).</p><pre class="screen">#ifdef WITH_SSL

it in a driver that’s relatively secluded.  However, if we have to work
on that code, expect it to get reformatted according to the above.</p><p>Patches to existing code that don’t conform to the coding style being
used in that file will probably be dropped.  If it’s something we really
need, it will be grudgingly reformatted before being included.</p><p>When in doubt, have a look at Linus’s take on this topic in the Linux

explaining this.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_line_breaks"></a>Line breaks</h4></div></div></div><p>It is better to have lines that are longer than 80 characters than to
wrap lines in random places. This makes it easier to work with tools
such as <code class="literal">grep</code>, and it also lets each developer choose their own
window size and tab setting without being stuck to one particular
choice.</p><p>Of course, this does not mean that lines should be made unnecessarily
long when there is a better alternative (see the note on
<code class="literal">pretentiousVariableNamingSchemes</code> above).  Certainly there should not
be more than one statement per line. Please do not use</p><pre class="screen">if (condition) break;</pre><p>but use the following:</p><pre class="screen">if (condition) {
        break;
}</pre><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Earlier revisions of coding style might suggest avoiding braces if just
one line is added as condition/loop/etc. handling code. Current approach is to
welcome them even for single lines: on one hand, this confirms the intention
that only this line is the conditional code; on another, this minimizes the
context differences for later code comparisons, relocation, refactoring, etc.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_un_used_variables_and_function_arguments"></a>Un-used variables and function arguments</h4></div></div></div><p>Whenever a function needs to satisfy a particular API, it can end up
taking arguments that are not used in practice (think a too-trivial
signal handler). While some compilers offer the facility of decorations
like <code class="literal">__attribute__(unused)</code>, this proved not to be a portable solution.
Also the abilities of newer C++ standard revisions are of no help to
the vast range of existing systems that run NUT today and expect to be
able to do so tomorrow (hence the required C99+ support noted above).</p><p>In NUT codebase we prefer to mark un-used variables explicitly in the
body of the function (or an <code class="literal">#ifdef</code> branch of its code) using the
<code class="literal">NUT_UNUSED_VARIABLE(varname)</code> as a routine call inside a function
body, referring to the macro defined in <code class="literal">common.h</code>.</p><p>Please note that for the purposes of legacy-compatible variable declarations
(on top of their scopes), <code class="literal">NUT_UNUSED_VARIABLE(varname)</code> counts as code and
should happen below the declarations.</p><p>To display in a rough example:</p><pre class="screen">        static void signal_X_handler(int signal_X) {
                NUT_UNUSED_VARIABLE(signal_X);
                /* We have explicitly got nothing to do if we catch signal X */
                return;
        }</pre><p>All this having been said, we do detect and use the support for pragmas
to quiesce the complaints about such situations, but limit their use to
processing of certain third-party header files.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_miscellaneous_coding_style_tools"></a>3.7. Miscellaneous coding style tools</h3></div></div></div><p>NUT codebase includes an <code class="literal">.editorconfig</code> file which should be supported
by most of the IDEs and text editors nowadays. Many support this format
specification (at least partially) out of the box, possibly with some
configuration toggle in the GUI. Others may need a plugin, see more at
<a class="ulink" href="https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed" target="_top">https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed</a> page. There are also command-line
tools to verify and/or enforce compliance of source files to configuration.</p><p>You can go a long way towards converting your source code to the NUT
coding style by piping it through the following command:</p><pre class="literallayout">indent -kr -i8 -T FILE -l1000 -nhnl</pre><p>This next command does a reasonable job of converting most C++ style
comments (but not URLs and DOCTYPE strings):</p><pre class="literallayout">sed 's#\(^\|[ \t]\)//[ \t]*\(.*\)[ \t]*#/* \2 */#'</pre><p>Emacs users can adjust how tabs are displayed. For example, it is
possible to set a tab stop to be 3 spaces, rather than the usual 8.
(Note that in the saved file, one indentation level will still
correspond to one tab stop; the difference is only how the file is
rendered on screen). It is even possible to set this on a
per-directory basis, by putting something like this into your <code class="literal">.emacs</code>
file:</p><pre class="screen">;; NUT style

from handling one case into another, modern compilers frown upon that
practice and spew warnings which complicate detecting real bugs in the
code (and also looking back at some of the cases written decades ago,
it is not trivial to state whether the fall-through was intentional or
really is a bug).</p><p>Compilers which detect such problem usually offer ways to decorate the
code with comments or attributes to keep it quiet it in cases where the
jump is intentional; also C++17 introduces special keywords for that in
the standard. NUT aiming to be portable and independent of compilers as
much as possible, prefers the arguably clearer and standards-based way
of using <code class="literal">goto</code> into the next intended operation, even though it is a
couple of lines away, e.g.:</p><pre class="literallayout">int uppercase = 0;
switch (char_opt) {

                break;
}</pre><p>In trivial cases, like falling through to <code class="literal">default</code> which just returns,
it may be clearer and more maintainable (adding other option cases in

fall through otherwise and avoid <code class="literal">goto</code> statements altogether.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_spaghetti"></a>Spaghetti</h4></div></div></div><p>If you use a <code class="literal">goto</code> that jumps over long distances (see "Switch case

the NUT source code. This allows you to clone the repository (or fork,
in GitHub parlance), make changes, and post them online for peer review
prior to integration.</p><p>To obtain permission to commit directly to the common upstream NUT repository,
you must be prepared to spend a fair amount of time contributing to the
NUT codebase. Most developers will be well served by committing to their
own forked Git repository (preferably in a uniquely named branch for each
new contribution), and having the NUT team merge their changes using pull
requests.</p><p>Git offers a little more flexibility than the <code class="literal">svn update</code> command.
You may fetch other developers' changes into your repository, but hold
off on actually combining them with your branch until you have compared
the two branches (for instance, with <code class="literal">gitk --all</code>). Git also allows you
to accumulate more than one commit worth of changes before pushing to
another repository. This allows development to continue without a constant
network connection.</p><p>For a quick change to a file in the Git working copy, you can use
<code class="literal">git diff</code> to generate a patch to send to the nut-upsdev mailing list.
If you have more extensive changes, you can use <code class="literal">git format-patch</code> on
a complete commit or branch, and send the resulting series of patches
to the list.</p><p>If you use GitHub’s web-based editor to make changes, it tends to create
lots of small commits, one per change per file. Unless there is reason to

that title is used throughout git.</p></blockquote></div><p>If your commit is just a change to one component, such as the HCL, upsd or a

(Are you correcting a typo in the previous commit? If you haven’t pushed yet,
consider using the <code class="literal">git commit --amend</code> command instead of creating a new
commit.) For other commits, even though tools like gitk and GitHub’s
repository viewers recognize Git hashes and create links automatically, it is
best to add some context such as the commit title or a date.</p><p>You may notice that some older commits have <code class="literal">[[SVN:####]]</code> tags and Fossil-ID
footers. These were lifted from the old SVN commit messages using reposurgeon,
and should <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> be used as a guide for future commits.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_commit_sign_off"></a>3.14. Commit sign-off</h3></div></div></div><p>Please also note that since 2023 we explicitly ask for contributions to be
"Signed Off" according to "Developer Certificate of Origin" as represented
in the <code class="literal">LICENSE-DCO</code> file in the root of NUT source tree (verbatim copy of
Version 1.1 of DCO published at <a class="ulink" href="https://developercertificate.org/" target="_top">https://developercertificate.org/</a> web site).
This is exactly the same one created and used by the Linux kernel developers.</p><p>This is a developer’s certification that he or she has the right to submit
the patch for inclusion into the project. Simply submitting a contribution
implies this agreement, however, please include a "Signed-off-by" tag in
every patch (this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to
the DCO). In other words, this tag certifies that committer has the rights
to submit this work under the same license as the project and agrees to the
terms of a Developer Certificate of Origin.</p><p>Note that while git commit hook tricks are available to automatically sign
off all commits, these signatures are intended to be a conscious (legally
meaningful) act — hence they are not automated in git core with an easy
configuration option.</p><p>For more details see:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

Please keep the Git "master" branch in working condition at all times.
The "master" branch may be used to generate daily tarballs, it provides the
baseline for new contributions, and occasionally is tagged for a new release.
It should not contain broken code. If you need to commit incremental changes
that leave the system in a broken state, please do so in a separate branch
and merge the changes back into "master" once they are complete.</p><p>To help keep the codebase ever-green, we run a number of CI tests and builds
in various conditions, including older compilers, different C/C++ standard
revisions, and an assortment of operating systems; a section below elaborates
on this in more detail.</p><p>You are encouraged to use <code class="literal">git rebase -i</code> on your private Git branches to
separate your changes into <a class="link" href="developers.html#_patch_cohesion" title="3.9. Patch cohesion">logical changes</a>.</p><p>From there, you can generate patches for the issue tracker, or the nut-upsdev
mailing list.</p><p>Note that once you rebase a branch, anyone else who has a copy of this branch
will need to rebase on top of your rebased branch. Obviously, this hinders
collaboration. In this case, we recommend that you rebase only in your private
repository, and push when things are ready for discussion. Merging instead of
rebasing will help with collaboration, but please do not turn the repository
history into a pile of spaghetti by merging unnecessarily. (Test merges can be
done on integration branches, which can be discarded if the merge is trivial.)
Be sure that your commit messages are descriptive when merging.</p><p>If you haven’t created a commit out of your local changes yet, and you want to
fetch the latest code, you can also use <code class="literal">git stash</code> before pulling, then <code class="literal">git
stash pop</code> to apply your saved changes.</p><p>Here is an example workflow:</p><pre class="screen">        git clone -o central git://github.com/networkupstools/nut.git

        cd nut
        git remote add -f username git://github.com/username/nut.git

        git checkout master
        git branch my-new-feature
        git checkout my-new-feature

        # Hack away

        git add changed-file.c
        git commit -s

        # Fix a typo in a file or commit message:

        git commit -s -a --amend

        # Someone committed something to the central repository. Fetch it.

        git fetch central
        git rebase central/master

        # Publish your branch to your GitHub repository:

        git push username my-new-feature</pre><p>If you are new to Git, but are familiar with SVN, some of the following links

invoke to build NUT. If you are making a number of changes to the NUT
source tree, configuring with the <code class="literal">--enable-maintainer-mode</code> flag will
ensure that after you change a <code class="literal">Makefile.am</code>, nearby <code class="literal">Makefile.in</code> and
<code class="literal">Makefile</code> get regenerated. At a minimum, you will need at least:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
autoconf
</li><li class="listitem">
automake
</li><li class="listitem">
libtool
</li><li class="listitem">
Python
</li><li class="listitem">
Perl
</li></ul></div><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>See the <a class="ulink" href="config-prereqs.txt" target="_top">config-prereqs.txt</a> for better detailed package lists for
different operating systems.</p><p>See <code class="literal">ci_build.sh</code> for automating many practical scenarios, for easier
iterations.</p><p>It is optional, but highly recommended, to have Python 2.x or 3.x, and Perl,
to generate some files included into the <code class="literal">configure</code> script whose presence
is checked by autotools when it is generated. Neutered files can be just
"touched" to pass the <code class="literal">autogen.sh</code> if these interpreters are not available,
and effectively skip those parts of the build later on — <code class="literal">autogen.sh</code> will
then advise which special environment variables to <code class="literal">export</code> in your situation
and re-run it.</p></div><p>Even if you do not use your distribution’s packages of NUT, installing the
distribution’s list of build dependencies for NUT can reduce the amount of
trial-and-error when installing dependencies. For instance, in Debian, you
can run <code class="literal">apt-get build-dep nut</code> to install all of the auto* tools as well
as any development libraries and headers.</p><p>After running <code class="literal">./autogen.sh</code>, you can pass your local configuration
options to <code class="literal">./configure</code> and run <code class="literal">make</code> from the top-level directory.
To avoid the need for root privileges when testing new NUT code, you
may wish to use <code class="literal">--prefix=$HOME/local/nut --with-statepath=/tmp</code>.
You can also keep compilation times down by only building the driver
which you are currently working on: <code class="literal">--with-drivers=driver1,dummy-ups</code>.</p><p>Before pushing your commits upstream, please run <code class="literal">make distcheck-light</code>.
This checks that the Makefiles are not broken, that all the relevant files
are distributed, and that there are no compilation or installation errors.
Note that unless you specifically pass <code class="literal">--with-doc=skip</code> to <code class="literal">configure</code>,
this requires all of the dependencies necessary to build the documentation
to be locally installed on your system, including <code class="literal">asciidoc</code>, <code class="literal">a2x</code>,
<code class="literal">xsltproc</code>, <code class="literal">dblatex</code> and any additional XSL stylesheets.</p><p>Running <code class="literal">make distcheck-light</code> is especially important if you have added or
removed files, or updated <code class="literal">configure.ac</code> or some <code class="literal">Makefile.am</code> file.
Remember: simply adding a file to Git does not mean it will be distributed.
To distribute a file, you must update the corresponding <code class="literal">Makefile.am</code> with
<code class="literal">EXTRA_DIST</code> entry and possibly other recipe handling.</p><p>There is also <code class="literal">make distcheck</code>, which runs an even stricter set of
tests than <code class="literal">make distcheck-light</code>, but will not work unless you have all
of the optional third-party libraries and features installed.</p><p>Finally note, that since 2017 the GitHub upstream project is monitored
by Travis CI (in addition to earlier multi-platform buildbots which
occasionally do not work), replaced since 2021 by a dedicated NUT CI farm.
This means that if your posted improvements are based on current NUT
"master" branch, the resulting pull request should get tested for a number of
scenarios automatically. If your code adds a substantial feature, consider
extending the <code class="literal">Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix</code> and/or <code class="literal">ci_build.sh</code> scripts in the
workspace root to add another <code class="literal">BUILD_TYPE</code> to the matrix of tests run in
parallel.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
