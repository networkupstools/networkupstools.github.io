<a class="ulink" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9271" target="_top">https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9271</a> and is referenced as the
document of record for the variable names and the instant commands used
in the protocol described by the RFC.</p><p>On behalf of the RFC, this document records the names of variables
describing the abstracted state of an UPS or similar power distribution
device, and the instant commands sent to the UPS using command <code class="literal">INSTCMD</code>,
as used in commands and messages between the Attachment Daemon (the <code class="literal">upsd</code>
in case of NUT implementation of the standard) and the clients.</p></div><p>This document defines the standard names of NUT commands and variables
(not to be confused with <a class="link" href="new-drivers.html#_status_data" title="Status data">device status data</a> described in
the <code class="literal">docs/new-drivers.txt</code> in NUT source codebase).</p><p>Developers should use the names recorded here, with dstate functions and
data mappings provided in NUT drivers for interactions with power devices.</p><p>If you need to express a state which cannot be described by any existing
name, please make a request to the NUT developers' mailing list for
definition and assignment of a new name.  Clients using unrecorded names
risk breaking at a future update.  If you wish to experiment with new
concepts before obtaining your requested variable name, you should use
a name of the form <code class="literal">experimental.x.y</code> for those states.</p><p>Put another way: if you make up a name that is not in this list and it
gets into the source code tree, and then the NUT community comes up with
a better name later, clients that already use the undocumented variable
will break when it is eventually changed.  An explicitly "experimental"
data point is less surprising in this regard.</p><p>Similarly, some source files (<code class="literal">drivers/*-mib.c</code> and <code class="literal">drivers/*-hid.c</code>)
may mention data point names following the pattern of <code class="literal">unmapped.x.y</code>.
These are generated by helper scripts which walk the reports from SNMP
and USB HID devices, respectively <code class="literal">scripts/subdriver/gen-snmp-subdriver.sh</code>
and <code class="literal">scripts/subdriver/gen-usbhid-subdriver.sh</code>, and assign names based on
strings in those reports. The <code class="literal">unmapped</code> entries should not be exposed in
"production" builds of the NUT drivers. They are an aid for developers to
know that such entries are served by their device, so an existing standard
NUT name can be assigned for the concept (or new name negotiated with the
community), but are normally hidden with <code class="literal">#if WITH_UNMAPPED_DATA_POINTS</code>
clauses which can be enabled in custom NUT builds by use of
<code class="literal">./configure --with-unmapped-data-points</code> option.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>In the descriptions, "opaque" means programs should not attempt to
parse the value for that variable as it may vary greatly from one UPS
(or similar device) to the next.  These strings are best handled directly
by the user.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
