numerous descendants of the OpenSolaris project, including both
the commercial Sun/Oracle Solaris 11 and illumos-based open source
distributions such as OpenIndiana and OmniOS. Recommendations
below may also apply to other related operating systems, possibly
to older releases as well.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_change_the_os_driver_binding_use_ugen"></a>1. Change the OS driver binding: use UGEN</h2></div></div></div><p>Like other hardware, USB devices are interfaced to the operating
system by OS drivers, and often there are several suitable drivers
with different capabilities. In Solaris and related systems, this
mapping is detailed in the <code class="literal">/etc/driver_aliases</code> file and properly
managed by dedicated tools. By default, USB devices can be captured
by the generic USB HID driver, or none at all; however an "UGEN"
driver can behave better with the libusb library used on Solaris.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Operations below would need running as <code class="literal">root</code> or elevating

                dev_link=/dev/usb/hid0</pre></li></ul></div><p>You can also check with <code class="literal">cfgadm</code> if the device is at least somehow visible
(if not, there can be hardware issues in play). For example, if there is a
physical link but no recognized driver was attached, the device would show
up as "unconfigured":</p><pre class="screen">:; cfgadm | grep usb-
usb8/1                 usb-input    connected    unconfigured ok</pre><p>If you conclude that a change is needed, you would need to unload
the existing copy of the "ugen" driver and set it up to handle the
device patterns that you find in <span class="emphasis"><em>compatible</em></span> values from <code class="literal">prtconf</code>.
For example, to monitor the devices from listings above, you would run:</p><pre class="screen">:; rem_drv ugen
:; add_drv -i '"usb463,ffff.100"' -m '* 0666 root sys' ugen</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">:; rem_drv ugen
:; add_drv -i '"usb665,5161.2"' -m '* 0666 root sys' ugen</pre><p>Note that there are many patterns in the <span class="emphasis"><em>compatible</em></span> line which
allow for narrower or wider catchment. It is recommended to match
with the narrowest fit, to avoid potential conflict with other
devices from same vendor (especially if the declared identifiers
are for a generic USB chipset).</p><p>Also note that the <code class="literal">add_drv</code> definition above lists the POSIX access
metadata for the device node files that would be generated when the
device is plugged in and detected. In the examples above, it would
be owned by <code class="literal">root:sys</code> but accessible for reads and writes (<code class="literal">0666</code>)
to anyone on the system. On shared systems you may want to constrain
this access to the account that the NUT driver would run as.</p><p>After proper driver binding, <code class="literal">cfgadm</code> should expose the details:</p><pre class="screen"># cfgadm -lv
...
usb8/1                         connected    configured   ok

    unavailable  usb-input    n        /devices/pci@0,0/pci103c,1309@1d,2:1
...</pre><p>Usually the driver mapping should set up the "friendly" device nodes
under <code class="literal">/dev/</code> tree as well (symlinks to real entries in <code class="literal">/devices/</code>)
so for NUT drivers you would specify a <code class="literal">port=/dev/usb/463.ffff/0</code> for
your new driver section in <code class="literal">ups.conf</code>.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>As detailed in <a class="ulink" href="config-notes.txt" target="_top">config-notes.txt</a>, the "natively USB" drivers
(including <code class="literal">usbhid-ups</code> and <code class="literal">nutdrv_qx</code>) match the device by ID and/or
strings it reports, and so effectively require but ignore the <code class="literal">port</code>
option — so it is commonly configured as <code class="literal">port=auto</code>.
Drivers used for SHUT or serial protocols do need the device path.</p></div><p>For some serial-to-USB converter chips however it was noted that while
the device driver is attached, and the <code class="literal">/device/...</code> path is exposed
in the <code class="literal">dmesg</code> output (saved to <code class="literal">/var/adm/messages</code>) the <code class="literal">/dev/...</code>
symlinks are not created. In this case you can pass the low-level
name of the character-device node as the "port" option, e.g.:</p><pre class="screen">./mge-shut -s 9px-ser -DDDDD -d2 -u root \
    -x port=/devices/pci@0,0/pci103c,1309@1a,2/device@1:0</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_libusb_version_and_binary"></a>2. libusb version and binary</h2></div></div></div><p>Until NUT release 2.7.4 the only option to build NUT drivers for
USB connectivity was to use libusb-0.1 or a distribution’s variant
of it; the original Sun Solaris releases and later related systems
provided their customized version for example (packaged originally
as <code class="literal">SUNWlibusbugen</code>, <code class="literal">SUNWugen{,u}</code> and <code class="literal">SUNWusb{,s,u,vc}</code>).</p><p>However, libusb-0.1 consuming programs had some stability issues
reported when running with long-term connections to devices (such
as an UPS), especially when using USB hubs and chips where hardware
vendors had cut a few corners too many, which were addressed in a
newer rewrite of the library as libusb-1.0.</p><p>Subsequently just as at least the illumos-based distributions evolved to
include the new library and certain patches for it, and the library
itself matured, the NUT project also added an ability to build with
libusb-1.0 either directly or using its 0.1-compat API (available since
NUT 2.8.0 release).</p><p>If your "standard" build of NUT has problems connecting to your USB UPS
(libusb binary variant should be visible in driver debug messages),
consider re-building NUT from source with the other option using the
recent library build as available for your distribution.</p><p>In this context, note the OpenIndiana libusb-1 package pull requests
with code which was successfully used when developing this documentation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

with messages like the following:</p><pre class="literallayout">Broadcast Message from nut (???) on n54l Mon May  9 12:05:59...

UPS innotech@localhost is unavailable</pre><p>Unfortunately, some devices "get stuck" on USB level (whether in the chips,
in the OS driver layer, libusb or NUT driver) and their NUT drivers have
to be restarted to regain monitoring, as opposed to intermittent losses
of connectivity that software recovers from automatically.</p><p>As in all systems, you should stop all programs using the connection,
including NUT driver instances that might have been started beside the
wrapping service (SMF). It may be possible to just start the new driver
instance at this point, but if it still does not see the device — you
have to re-initialize the connection on the OS level.</p><p>As a symptom, attempts to start the NUT driver with elevated debug verbosity
would not even see the device details:</p><pre class="screen">   0.000606     [D1] Saving PID 5187 into /var/run/nut/nutdrv_qx-innotech.pid
