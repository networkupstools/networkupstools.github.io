that were applied at different times by the maintainer team to ensure
regular builds and tests of the codebase.  Whether these are used in
daily production today or not, similar setup should be possible locally
on developer and contributor machines.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_multiple_foss_ci_providers_and_technologies"></a>4.2. Multiple FOSS CI providers and technologies</h3></div></div></div><p>While there are many FOSS-friendly CI offerings, they are usually (and
reasonably) focused on the OS market leaders — offering recent releases
of Linux, Windows and MacOS build agents, and sometimes a way to "bring
your own device" to cover other systems.  The NUT CI farm does benefit
from those offerings as well, using GitHub Actions with CodeQL for Linux
code quality inspection, AppVeyor CI for Windows, and CircleCI for MacOS,
to name a few.</p><p>But on the other hand, being a massively multi-platform effort (and aiming
to support older boxes that are still alive even if their vendors and/or
distro versions are not), a comprehensive NUT CI approach requires many
machines running uncommon operating systems.  This is where custom virtual
machines help, and more so — a core set of those hosted in the cloud and
dedicated to the project, rather than only some resources intermittently
contributed by community members which come and go.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Community-provided builders running on further systems are also
welcome, and the option is of course supported, as managed by the
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix" target="_top">Jenkins-Dynamatrix</a>
effort which appeared due to such need, and runs the core NUT CI farm.</p></div><p>We have also had historic experience with FOSS CI providers (and community
members' machines) disappearing, so having NUT CI farm goals covered by
multiple independent implementations is also a feature beyond having yet
another set of digital eyes looking at our code quality (which is also a
goal in itself).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_jenkins_is_the_way"></a>4.3. Jenkins is the way</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

for the practical pipeline preparation and hand-off to library implementation.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_jenkins_ci"></a>Jenkins CI</h4></div></div></div><p><a id="NUT_CI_JENKINS"></a>Since mid-2021, the NUT CI farm is implemented by several virtual servers
courteously provided originally by <a class="ulink" href="http://fosshost.org" target="_top">Fosshost</a> and
later by
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d2fbf2b9e082&amp;utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&amp;utm_medium=Referral_Program&amp;utm_source=badge" target="_top">DigitalOcean</a>.</p><p>These run various operating systems as build agents, and a Jenkins instance
to orchestrate the builds of NUT branches and pull requests on those agents.</p><p>This is driven by <code class="literal">Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix</code> and a Jenkins Shared Library called
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix" target="_top">jenkins-dynamatrix</a>
which prepares a matrix of builds across as many operating systems,
bitnesses/architectures, compilers, make programs and C/C++ revisions
as it can — based on the population of currently available build agents
and capabilities which they expose as agent labels.</p><p>This hopefully means that people interested in NUT can contribute to the
build farm (and ensure NUT is and remains compatible with their platform)
by running a Jenkins Swarm agent with certain labels, which would dial
into <a class="ulink" href="https://ci.networkupstools.org/" target="_top">https://ci.networkupstools.org/</a> controller. Please contact the NUT
maintainer if you want to participate in this manner.</p><p>The <code class="literal">Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix</code> recipe allows NUT CI farm to run different sets
of build scenarios based on various conditions, such as the name of branch
being built (or PR’ed against), changed files (e.g. C/C++ sources vs. just
docs), and some build combinations may be not required to succeed.</p><p>For example, the main development branch and pull requests against it must
cleanly pass all specified builds and tests on various platforms with the
default level of warnings specified in the <code class="literal">configure</code> script. These are
balanced to not run too many build scenarios overall, but just a quick and
sufficiently representative set.</p><p>As another example, there is special handling for "fightwarn" pattern in
the branch names to run many more builds with varying warning levels and
more variants of intermediate language revisions, and so expose concerns
deliberately missed by default warnings levels in "master" branch builds
(the bar moves over time, as some classes of warnings become extinct from
our codebase).</p><p>Further special handling for branches named like <code class="literal">fightwarn.*89.*</code> regex
enables more intensive warning levels for a GNU89 build specifically (which
are otherwise disabled as noisy yet not useful for supported C99+ builds),
and is intended to help develop fixes for support of this older language
revision, if anyone would dare.</p><p>Many of those unsuccessful build stages are precisely the focus of the
"fightwarn" effort, and are currently marked as "may fail", so they end
up as "UNSTABLE" (seen as orange bubbles in the Jenkins BlueOcean UI, or
orange cells in the tabular list of stages in the legacy UI), rather than
as "FAILURE" (red bubbles) for build scenarios that were not expected to
fail and usually represent higher-priority problems that would block a PR.</p><p>Developers whose PR builds (or attempts to fix warnings) did not succeed in
some cell of such build matrix, can look at the individual logs of that cell.
Beside indication from the compiler about the failure, the end of log text
includes the command which was executed by CI worker and can be reproduced
locally by the developer, e.g.:</p><pre class="screen">22:26:01  FINISHED with exit-code 2 cmd:  (
22:26:01  [ -x ./ci_build.sh ] || exit
22:26:01
22:26:01  eval BUILD_TYPE="default-alldrv" BUILD_WARNOPT="hard" \
    BUILD_WARNFATAL="yes" MAKE="make"  CC=gcc-10 CXX=g++-10 \
    CPP=cpp-10 CFLAGS='-std=gnu99 -m64' CXXFLAGS='-std=gnu++11 -m64' \
    LDFLAGS='-m64' ./ci_build.sh
22:26:01  )</pre><p>or for autotools-driven scenarios (which prep, configure, build and test
in separate stages — so for reproducing a failed build you should also
look at its configuration step separately):</p><pre class="screen">22:28:18  FINISHED with exit-code 0 cmd:  ( [ -x configure ] || exit; \
    eval  CC=clang-9 CXX=clang++-9 CPP=clang-cpp-9 CFLAGS='-std=c11 -m64' \
    CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11 -m64' LDFLAGS='-m64' time ./configure )</pre><p>To re-run such scenario locally, you can copy the line from <code class="literal">eval</code> (but
without the <code class="literal">eval</code> keyword itself) up to and including the executed script
or tool, into your shell. Depending on locally available compilers, you
may have to tweak the <code class="literal">CC</code>, <code class="literal">CXX</code> and <code class="literal">CPP</code> arguments; note that a <code class="literal">CPP</code>
may be specified as <code class="literal">/path/to/CC -E</code> for GCC and CLANG based toolkits
at least, if they lack a standalone preprocessor program (e.g. IntelCC).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>While NUT recipes do not currently recognize a separate <code class="literal">CXXCPP</code>,
it would follow similar semantics.</p></div><p>Some further details about the NUT CI farm workers are available in
