<div class="paragraph"><p>This document describes the serial port communication protocol used by the Belkin "Universal UPS" and compatible models.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This document describes the serial port communication protocol used by the Belkin "Universal UPS".
This protocol is known to work with the F6C800-UNV and F6C120-UNV models, and presumably also works with the other Universal UPS models, such as the F6C500-UNV, F6C100-UNV, and so forth.
Note that this protocol does not work with the Belkin "Home Office" series, nor with the "Regulator Pro" series.
For some pointers to information on other Belkin protocols, see <a href="#otherprotocols">Note: Other Belkin Protocols</a> below.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_general_information">General Information</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>I bought a Belkin "Universal UPS" because, next to APC, Belkin systems are among the most widely available in stores, at least in Canada.
For instance, they are available from Radio Shack, Target, Office Depot, etc.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the surface, Belkin seems Linux-friendly, because they provide a Linux version of their "Bulldog Plus" UPS management software.
This software is not included on the CD Rom which ships with the UPS, but one can download it from <a href="http://www.belkin.com/pyramid/AdvancedInfo/UPS/Bulldog/">Belkin&#8217;s website</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, unfortunately, the Bulldog Plus software is not as useful as it might seem.
It has many bugs (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050408231453/http://quasar.mathstat.uottawa.ca/~selinger/ups/#bulldog">Bugs in Bulldog</a>), and it cannot be configured to allow an unsupervised recovery (the user must press the front panel button to restart the UPS after a power failure).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since the specifications of the protocol were not available, I decided to do some detective work and to decipher the protocol myself.
The results are described in this document.
The information reported here is necessarily incomplete, but it seems that the most important aspects of the protocol have been covered.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately, there is one serious problem with the "Universal UPS" firmware: there is no command which causes the UPS to go into "soft shutdown" mode, which means, to shut off the load until AC power returns.
This makes unsupervised recovery from power failures tricky and awkward (see <a href="#workaround">Soft Shutdown Workaround</a> for a suggested solution).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On balance, the Belkin UPS works fine, but the lack of a "soft shutdown" command is annoying.
If you are thinking about buying a UPS, I think currently APC is a better choice than Belkin at approximately the same price.
Maybe Belkin will come up with an improved version of their firmware in the future.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="otherprotocols">Note: Other Belkin Protocols</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Belkin uses different communication protocols for different UPS hardware.
Belkin&#8217;s "Bulldog Plus" software apparently knows several of these protocols, and automatically figures out which one to use based on the responses it receives from the UPS.
I know of the following protocols.
The "NUT Driver" entries below refer to the Network UPS Tools software.</p></div>

<div class="content">From my testing with Belkin&#8217;s software, the F6C units and F6H units appear to NOT be software compatible.
Belkin&#8217;s Bulldog Plus software (Windows or UNIX, either from the included CD or from the web site) refuses to talk to the F6H units, but the basic Bulldog software (Windows or UNIX) on the CD that comes with the F6H units works just fine (although appears to be extremely limited in capability) with those units.</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="workaround">Soft Shutdown Workaround</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The main problem with the Belkin Universal UPS is that there appears to be no software way to put the UPS into "soft shutdown" mode.
This makes unsupervised recovery from power failures tricky.
There is a reliable workaround, as described in this section, but it is awkward.
One must conclude that Belkin&#8217;s engineers do not understand the purpose of a UPS very well, at least as it relates to unsupervised recovery.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To understand the issue, consider what should normally happen to an unsupervised computer (such as a server) during a power failure:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The AC power fails, and the UPS goes on battery mode.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When the battery gets low, the computer enters its normal shutdown sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As the very last step of the shutdown process, the computer signals the UPS to do a "soft shutdown", i.e., to turn its load off and await AC power.
This kills the computer&#8217;s power supply, and thus the computer is turned off.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When the power comes back on, the UPS load comes back on, restoring the computer&#8217;s power supply, and thus causing the computer to reboot.
(Note that there is a BIOS setting by which one can tell the computer to reboot after power loss).
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Moreover, if AC power happens to be restored during step 2, the UPS should still turn its load off briefly in step 3, to allow the computer to reboot.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The problem with the Belkin UPS is that step 3 is not possible.
One cannot signal the UPS to do a "soft shutdown".
One can only signal it to do a "final shutdown", which means, the UPS stays off even if the power returns.
This leaves the entire system in a state where a human needs to press the button on the UPS front panel to restart the system.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is one way around this problem.
Namely, the UPS will enter "soft shutdown" mode when its batteries run out.
Thus, it is possible to handle a power failure as follows:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The AC power fails, and the UPS goes on battery mode.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When the battery gets low, the computer enters its normal shutdown sequence.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As the very last step of the shutdown process, we call a special program which does nothing but to monitor the UPS status.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the AC power comes back on before the batteries run out, our program notices this and causes the computer to reboot.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the batteries run out before the AC power comes back on, then the UPS shuts off its load, thereby killing the computer&#8217;s power supply.
The UPS is now in "soft shutdown" mode and everything will reboot when the power comes back on.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The major practical drawback of this solution is that the battery level is guaranteed to be 0% when the system reboots.
Thus, if another power failure happens before the batteries are recharged, the system will crash with not enough warning to do an orderly shutdown.
We can solve this problem by adding another special purpose program to the startup script, before anything is written to the hard disks, which monitors the UPS and waits for the battery level to reach a minimum amount before allowing the boot process to resume.
This ensures that the system is in a safe state, should the power fail again.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I have implemented the required functionality as part of the NUT <em>belkinunv</em> driver.
The <em>belkinunv</em> driver can be used as a standalone program by calling it with the "<code>-x wait</code>" option.
When called with this option, the driver does not fork into the background, but simply connects to the UPS and waits for AC power to be restored.
The intention is that one puts commands such as the following as the last part of the computer&#8217;s shutdown script:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code># NEAR END OF SHUTDOWN SCRIPT:
# if shutdown was caused by UPS, perform Belkin UPS workaround.
if [ -f /etc/killpower ] ; then
    echo "Waiting for AC power, or for UPS batteries to run out..."
    /usr/bin/belkinunv -x wait /dev/ttyS1

    # we get here if the power came back on. Reboot.
    echo "Power is back. Rebooting..."
    reboot
fi</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition, when called with the "<code>-x wait=level</code>" option, the belkinunv driver waits for the battery charge to reach the specified level.
This can be used in a startup script as follows.
Put this before any disks are mounted read/write, and before any file system integrity checks, so that the system is in a safe state.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code># NEAR BEGINNING OF STARTUP SCRIPT:
# if we are recovering from a power failure, wait for the UPS to
# charge to a comfortable level before writing anything to disk
if [ -f /etc/killpower ] ; then
    echo "Waiting for UPS battery charge to reach 60%..."
    /usr/bin/belkinunv -x wait=60 -x nohang /dev/ttyS1
fi</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here, the "<code>-x nohang</code>" option ensures that the computer will boot properly in case the UPS is no longer attached.
There might be many reasons to remove the UPS during a power failure, for instance, you take your computer to a friend&#8217;s house, or you attach it to a generator, or whatever.
Giving the "<code>-x nohang</code>" option ensures that your computer is always bootable.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For a detailed description of the "<code>-x wait</code>" and related options, please see the <em>belkinunv(8)</em> man page.</p></div>

<h3 id="_opening_the_serial_communication_link">Opening the serial communication link</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The serial port parameters are: 2400 baud, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity.
More precisely, the following parameters are used: <code>B2400 | CS8 | CREAD | HUPCL | CLOCAL</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In order to get the UPS to switch to "smart" mode, one first needs to set RTS and drop DTR for at least 0.25 seconds (RTS and DTR refer to two specific pins in the 9-pin serial connector).
This signals the UPS to switch to serial mode.
Without this step, there will be no serial communication possible.
In experimenting with my own UPS, I found that 0.25 seconds is the minimum time required for the UPS to react; however, the time required may differ for different UPS hardware.
The Bulldog software waits 1 second, so this is probably a safe bet.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After this, flush any unread garbage bytes from the serial port.
Thereafter, simply communicate with the port via usual "read" and "write" operations.</p></div>

Some registers are read-only.
There either hold hard-coded values (such as the UPS model name or nominal voltage rating), or they describe the state of the UPS, such as the current battery voltage or whether certain events have occurred.
Some other registers can be read and written.
These registers control or configure aspects of the UPS&#8217;s behavior, such as its voltage sensitivity, or whether the audible alarm is enabled.
In some cases, setting the value of a writable register triggers an event, such as a battery self-test or a UPS shutdown.</p></div>

We always write register ID&#8217;s as hexadecimal values.</p></div>

Some registers hold a 1-byte integer, others hold a 2-byte integer, and others hold a variable length string.</p></div>

This flag is not set during battery self-tests (unless the power fails at the same time).

On my UPS, it seems to be set precisely if (1) the UPS is operating on Battery power and the alarm is physically ringing, including during a test, or (2) the UPS is operating on AC power.
The Bulldog software uses this flag as the basis for the "Buzzer Alarm" status flag (in the "Status" display), with the annoying effect that this flag is almost always on, even when the buzzer is not ringing.
Maybe this is a bug in my UPS&#8217;s firmware.
In any case, it seems that the buzzer is actually ringing if and only if flag <code>0x8000</code> in register <code>22</code> and flag <code>0x20</code> in register <code>23</code> are both set.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also note that my UPS sets <code>0x0005</code> on AC Failure; however, the <code>0x0004</code> bit is apparently ignored by the Bulldog software.</p></div>

If <code>0x0008</code> is not set, this is not necessarily the case (unless, strangely, register <code>1f</code> was <code>0x00</code> or <code>0x20</code> during startup).
It is not clear to what extent this behavior means anything, and to what extent it just reveals idiosyncrasies in the Bulldog software.</p></div>

First, the UPS will switch to battery power (and the buzzer will beep every 10 seconds unless disabled).

<li>

The battery voltage and battery level will decrease continually.

</li>
<li>
<p>
When the battery level falls below 15, the "battery low" flag will come on, thus the battery status become <code>0x24</code>.
</p>
</li>

<p>
At the same time the buzzer will start ringing fast and can no longer be disabled.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The UPS status is unchanged at <code>0x8005</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The battery voltage and level will continue to drop, and the UPS will continue to supply power, even when the battery level reaches 0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally, after the battery level has been 0 for a while, the UPS turns its load off and does a "soft shutdown".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
At this point, the battery status becomes <code>0x40</code> (battery depleted) and the UPS status becomes <code>0xa001</code> (AC failure and awaiting power).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If one now turns the AC power back on, the UPS will power up and enter UPS status <code>0x8000</code> and battery status <code>0x10</code>.
</p>
</li>

<p>
There should be a way of initiating a soft shutdown without waiting for the batteries to run out.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Some information is still missing.
There must be some flags which I have not observed during my tests, in particular, there should be flags for: Bypass Active, Fan Failure, Fuse Break, Inverter Bad, Charger Bad, Bypass Bad.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I am not sure how registers <code>06</code>-<code>0b</code> interact with register <code>0c</code>.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Here are some areas in which the Belkin Universal UPS firmware could be improved:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
add a command to shut down the load and put UPS into "awaiting power" mode.
This should "flash" the load briefly (shut the load off and back on) in case AC power is already present.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
allow shutdown timer and restart timer to be reset to <code>0</code> to cancel a pending shutdown, rather than starting to count from 65535.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
allow timers to be set more accurately.
Currently, by setting the restart timer to <code>1</code>, it might expire anywhere between immediately and 60 seconds.
In particular, it is not possible to set both the shutdown timer and the restart timer to <code>1</code> at the same time, because there is no guarantee that the first timer won&#8217;t expire before the second one is set.
Thus, it is not possible to do a reliable timed shutdown of less than 2 minutes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Calculate battery level more accurately.
Currently, this is a simple function of battery voltage, which means that the levels are interpreted very differently in battery mode than in line mode.
This could be compensated for in software, but not reliably, as the battery levels might differ from one hardware/firmware version to the next.
